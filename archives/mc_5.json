During his last year at New York University, Taylor worked in the auditor’s department of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Upon leaving NYU, he worked briefly in a bank in Lewiston, Montana; then he was involved for a time in an oil venture in Montana. In 1823, he became deputy superintendent of banks for the State of Montana. In March 1926 he was chosen as secretary manager of the United States Building and Loan Association of Butte, Montana. In 1938, the Butte firm merged with a small Salt Lake City association, Prudential Savings and Loan Association; on March 31, 1938, Taylor was named President. In July 1938 Taylor arranged for the purchase of the Columbia Trust Company Building in Salt Lake City, and the new main office of Prudential Federal Savings and Loan Association opened there on December 28, 1938. Taylor was responsible for major growth of this institution. He retired as manager on July 31, 1962, at age 70, having served for 36 years. At that time he became President, Director, and Consultant to the Board. Through the years he had been extremely active in roles of civic responsibility.
