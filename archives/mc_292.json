Baranowski earned his BS in Chemical Engineering from the New York University School of Engineering in 1943, and his MS from the University of Tennessee. During World War II he served as a Second Lt. Army Corps of Engineers at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia and the combat engineers at Ft. Leonard Wood, Missouri. In 1945 he transferred to the Manhattan Project. He left the service in 1947 as a Captain and later worked for the Atomic Energy Commission, where he held various positions (including Director of Production and Nuclear Fuel Cycle) through the Agency's change to the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). The Frank Baranowski Collection contains a 1939 freshman certificate, and New York University Bulletin commencement edition and a graduation program from 1943."
