He served in the United States Army during World War II as a scientist assigned to the Manhattan Project.

This collection consists of letters addressed to Sgt. Harold Edelhoch from 1943 to 1946 written by Edelhoch's friends, colleagues, and fellow servicemen from World War II. Many of the letters were written by Elizabeth Bristol Greenleaf, who was married to the Department of Chemistry Chair William Greenleaf and worked in the chemistry department's library while Edelhoch was a student at NYU.
