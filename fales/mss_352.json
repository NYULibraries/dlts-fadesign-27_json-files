As of 2017, he lives and writes in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts. \nThis collection contains letters between Giannini and Enslin beginning in 1981 until Enslin’s death in 2011. Throughout their 30 year friendship, Giannini and Enslin corresponded regularly from their homes in New Mexico, Maine, and western Massachusetts, discussing weather, politics, health, and personal issues. They also critiqued each other's writings and shared reading recommendations. Critiques and news of other writer friends including Cid Corman, John Taggart, and George Oppen can also be found in this collection."
