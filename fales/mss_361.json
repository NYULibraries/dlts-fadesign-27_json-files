SOUP published Lally's book,  \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eThe South Orange Sonnets,\u003c/emph\u003e in 1972. In 1975 Lally separated from his first wife, the poet Lee Lally, and moved to New York, where he wrote poetry; founded a small publishing company, O Press; and also edited the anthology \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eNone of the Above: New Poets of the USA.\u003c/emph\u003e\n\u003clb/\u003e\n\u003clb/\u003e\nIn 1982 Lally moved to Los Angeles to pursue opportunities in film and television as a writer and actor.

In addition to writing his own original screenplays and plays, Lally was a script doctor in which he contributed to existing screenplays. During his time in Los Angeles, Lally co-founded the Poetry in Motion series (1988–1996), which received media attention for its mix of Hollywood celebrities and poets. While living in California Lally also helped found and edit the original \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eVenice\u003c/emph\u003e magazine. \n\u003clb/\u003e\n\u003clb/\u003e\nLally has published over 27 books of poetry and memoirs.
