Morris Slotkin was active in the Brooklyn-based Boy Scout Troop 26 from 1923 to 1953. After graduating high school, he worked as a librarian at the New York Public Library until the Second World War (WWII). Following the war, he returned to Brooklyn and worked for the federal government. The Slotkin family moved to Lancaster, PA in 1953 and then to St. Louis, MO in 1955. Morris Slotkin remained active in the Troop 26 Alumni Association until his death in 1990."

Many streets from which the photographs were taken are identified including Bedford Avenue, Wythe Avenue, and Kent Avenue."
