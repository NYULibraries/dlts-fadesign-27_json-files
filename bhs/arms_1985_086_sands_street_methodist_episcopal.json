The church was the first Methodist Church established in Brooklyn. This collection consists of one class register and three church programs."

Based on the practices of English preacher and theologian John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, the practice of class meetings were brought to New York as early as 1766 by itinerant preachers such as Francis Asbury. Class meetings served as a way to learn Methodist doctrine under the guidance of class leaders. Attendees were required to attend weekly class meetings for as long as six months. During class, attendees would be instructed in Church doctrine by class leaders, hear testimonials from fellow classmates, as well as participate themselves by sharing their own professions of faith. Through the attendance and completion of class meetings, new members would be admitted to the Church. Class meetings were often segregated based on race and gender, though this began to change in the mid-19th century. The practice of class meetings slowly declined by the end of the 19th century, though recently, there has been resurgence in the practice."
