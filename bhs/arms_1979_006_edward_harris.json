Harris's travels took him from Maine to North Carolina, from eastern Long Island (N.Y.) to Ohio, often repeatedly. Overall, Harris's memoir provides insight into an itinerant ministry as a career choice, principally in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, in the nineteenth century."

Returning again to Philadelphia in 1819, and on to Princeton, New Jersey, he was licensed to preach in 1822. He would be ordained in 1830. Largely an itinerant minister spending fairly short periods with any one congregation, Harris's career took him to Long Island, several New England states (including Maine and Connecticut), Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Ohio. He even preached and worked in North Carolina in the late 1850s despite his abhorrence of slavery. Harris preached 3,876 sermons, travelled 124,884 miles, and received $6,746.84 (by his own calculations) for his services. (Source: Harris's memoir)"
