Meeker Avenue in Williamsburg is named in his honor. David E. Meeker (circa 1828-1889) lived at 255 Jefferson Avenue in the neighborhood now known as Bedford-Stuyvesant.

For example, property on South Second Street would not be listed as 234 South Second Street, but rather South Second Street property, north side, between Third and Fourth Avenues. Most property deeds and mortgages include hand drawn maps of the blocks and described property lots, providing a more exact location description."
