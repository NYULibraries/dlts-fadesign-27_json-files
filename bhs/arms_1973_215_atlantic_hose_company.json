Its first headquarters was a shed on High Street, and in 1836 it moved to Firemen's Hall on Poplar Street until 1851 when it moved to the new Firemen's Hall on Henry Street. That same year the company renamed itself the Atlantic Hose Company No. 1 and remained active until 1869, when Brooklyn's first paid professional Fire Department went into operation and the Volunteer Fire Department was disbanded."
