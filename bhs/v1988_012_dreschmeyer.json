Dreschmeyer (1896-1983) was a lifetime resident at 2014 Stanhope Street in the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens (1)(2); Ridgewood was formerly part of Brooklyn until 1977. Otto C.Dreschmeyer was never married, and had a sister named Ella (1899-1980)whom also lived at the family's residence. Ella was briefly married to Arthur Piens, who died in 1942, thus her name was changed to Ella Piens (3). Dreschmeyer's father's name was Otto as well, his mother was Theresa (nee Schrader), and they were both immigrants from Germany (4). There is very little known about Otto C. Dreschmeyer's life other than a tragic car accident that he caused in 1936, reported on in the New York Times (5). There is also a draft card registration for Dreschmeyer from 1942 (6). Dreschmeyer took these photographs in his later years, and it is unknown as to why he photographed."
