Visual items in the collection include cabinet cards of Edna Volck's elder relatives, portraits of her parents, photographs of her travels (mostly cruises), and photographs of her life in Brooklyn. A handful of photographs and ephemera, such as birthday cards, document Edna Volck's 100th birthday in 1986. Lastly, handwritten interview transcripts taken by donor Margery Cronshaw provide a first-person perspective on Edna Volck's life."
