At the time that the monument was erected, it was believed that Hale had also been captured at Huntington and the memorial reflected this claim. This claim was disputed in later years by historians who contended that Hale was in fact captured on the island of Manhattan in New York City. In 1939, a committee was formed by the Board of the Town of Huntington to conduct research into the true site of Hale's capture and determine whether or not the wording on the Hale monument should be revised. After conducting its research, the committee concluded that the historical information suggesting New York City as the site of Hale's capture was inconclusive, and that the monument should remain unchanged."

Included are a narrative research report by the committee charged with investigating the site of Nathan Hale's capture, dated 1939; a summary report to the Board of the Town of Huntington, circa 1939; and a brief research report written by the Town Historian of Huntington, circa 1957. The narrative report provides a detailed account of the competing claims regarding the site of Hale's capture, discusses many of the historical documents consulted by the committee, and lays out their conclusions regarding the site of Hale's capture. The summary report of the committee to the Board of the Town of Huntington summarizes the committee's findings and provides a detailed list of all historical resources consulted by the committee. The report written by the Town Historian of Huntington suggests that contention over the site of Hale's capture did not die off following the findings and conclusions of the 1939 committee. The Town Historian's report concurs with the earlier committee's conclusion that Huntington's monument to Nathan Hale should remain unchanged."
