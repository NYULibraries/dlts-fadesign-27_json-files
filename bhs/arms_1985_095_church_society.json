Accordingly, between 1916 and 1921 the Society's official name changed to The Brooklyn and Long Island Church Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church."

The colllection also includes a commemorative program for the Society's 25th anniversary celebration in 1903. The program features a group photograph of the Society's executive committee, an historical sketch of the Society, and an overview of Society's work."
