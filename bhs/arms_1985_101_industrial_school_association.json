The Association's approach to its work was expressly religious in nature, with a strong emphasis placed on Christian moral principles. It was founded by female members of several Brooklyn churches, and thereafter its staff and Board of Managers was comprised entirely of women representing the different Christian denominations of Brooklyn."

It consists entirely of annual reports, which feature financial statements, summaries of activities and accomplishments for each year, lists of donations and donors, as well as the Association's constitution and by-laws. These reports do not feature the names or adoption records of any residents of the Home for Destitute Children. A particular strength of the collection is its insight into society's attitudes regarding poverty during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, specifically the perceived relationship between poverty and moral depravity."
