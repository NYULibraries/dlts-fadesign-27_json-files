The majority of the images in the collection are group portraits of clubs and classes at Emmanuel House, such as the Kindergarten, Sunday school, sewing school, scouts, and baseball team. In addition to group portraits, the collection includes informal photographs of the clubs' recreational activities, such as camping and swimming. Some slides originate from commercial slide studios, namely the Radio Mat Slide Company and Charles A. Beseler."
