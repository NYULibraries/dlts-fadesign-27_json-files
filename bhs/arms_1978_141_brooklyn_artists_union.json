The records include proceeding minutes of the Brooklyn Artists Union, and poetry by unknown authors. The Brooklyn Artists Union was founded in April 1851. At an exposition in June of that year at 238 Fulton Street, the Union was scheduled to show member artwork and have a raffle with a door prize in order to raise funds. New York State officials viewed the event as gambling and enacted a law forbidding the exhibition. The Union presumably dissolved shortly thereafter."
