Between 1851 and 1899, the church had installed six pastors, several of whom had become very influential within the Congregational denomination, including Rev. Rufus Wheelwright Clark, Rev. Henry M. Storrs, and Rev. Albert J. Lyman. The church building, located at Court and President Streets, was built in several stages between the years 1857 to 1893."
