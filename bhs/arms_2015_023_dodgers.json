As the organizer of the Islip night out at Ebbets Field, he was part of a group of community leaders invited in 1952 to attend four days of the Brooklyn Dodgers' spring training camp at \"Dodgertown\" in Vero Beach, Florida, where attendees had the opportunity to observe practice and mingle with players and executives."
