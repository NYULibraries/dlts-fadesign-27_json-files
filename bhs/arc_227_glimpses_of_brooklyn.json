The viewbooks were published by the Mercantile Illustrating Company in 1894. Images of Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, Green-Wood Cemetery, and Brooklyn Heights are included and captions accompany each image. Each viewbook contains 23 pages, measuring 7.2 x 10.5. One of the original softcovers has been recovered with a hardcover library binding that is now brittle, while many of its pages have separated from its binding. The other viewbook retains its original softcover, but some of its pages were previously water damaged. Digital versions of the images from the viewbooks are available via the image database located in the library."
