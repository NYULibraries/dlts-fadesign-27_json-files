Under the new church organization in America, the first Anglican services were held in Brooklyn in 1784. The Episcopal Churches of Brooklyn collection spans the years 1832 to 1985 and contains records or materials relating to 16 Episcopal churches that were once or are still located in Brooklyn, N.Y. Included in the collection are church programs, annual reports, membership lists, yearbooks, directories, and newsletters. The yearbooks are of particular interest as they often contain membership lists."
