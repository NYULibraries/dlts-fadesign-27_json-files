Highlights include the annual reports, which provide lists of churches that were part of the Union, in addition to documenting a controversy that arose when the Union requested to use public school space for religious education classes during the 1850s. Additionally, the event programs include materials pertaining to Anniversary Day, an annual holiday originally conceived to celebrate the founding of Brooklyn's first sabbath school. Over the years, this holiday went through several name changes, was gradually secularized, and ultimately became Brooklyn-Queens Day, an official holiday for public school students in all five of New York City's boroughs."
