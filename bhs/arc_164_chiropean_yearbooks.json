The yearbooks contain the club's certificate of incorporation, constitution, and bylaws; the schedule of meetings for the year; programs for the monthly meetings (Report of Exercises); the standing rules; lists of former presidents; lists of officers and standing committees; and membership lists. The Report of Exercises lists titles of the addresses, papers, dramatic readings, and musical selections presented or performed during the meetings. The membership list includes the names and addresses of members. The supplements to the yearbooks include financial reports, as well as list newly admitted members, and note changes of officers and committee changes."
