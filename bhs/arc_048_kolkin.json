Lucy remained in Brooklyn while Alfred trained and went at sea, and lived with her parents at 8620 20th Avenue in Bensonhurst. Letters indicate that she planned to visit California in September of 1944 to be with Al during his stateside training but became ill and did not go or did not complete the trip. She apparently became employed in clerical office work as of 1945."
