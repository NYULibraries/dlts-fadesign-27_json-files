In the state of New York, cities were allocated troop quotas. At the time of the Civil War, both the City of New York and the City of Brooklyn were comprised of small political units, or wards, that were in turn allocated troop quotas. The Third Ward Enlistment Committee was responsible for filling the ward's quotas. Post war, as of 1867, Third Ward boundaries consisted of what is now part of the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Heights, Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, and Park Slope. The Third Ward Enlistment Committee records, housed in three folders, include a treasurer's account book, 1862 to 1871; a volunteer's journal, 1862; and three subscription journals for troop quotas, 1862."
