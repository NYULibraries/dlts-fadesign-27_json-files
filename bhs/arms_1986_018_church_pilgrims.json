The Church of the Pilgrims, Brooklyn's first Congregational church, was established on December 22, 1844. Construction on the Church's building, located at the corner of Henry and Remsen Streets in the neighorhood of Brooklyn Heights, had begun in July of 1844, though it was not until May of 1846 that the building was officially dedicated. The Church's first pastor, the Reverend Richard Salter Storrs (1821-1900), was installed in November of 1846."
