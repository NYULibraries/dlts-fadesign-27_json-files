In 1967, the Brooklyn Navy Yard was acquired by the City of New York and was converted for private commercial use."

Items in the collection include personnel forms and correspondence relative to Rudon's position as a civilian employee, employee publications, and office memoranda. Photographs in the collection depict scenes of Navy Yard office work, including members of the local union and the library where Evelyn Rudon was employed. Rudon is a subject in all photographs in the series, which include black-and-white glossy prints and a polaroid. Material in the collection documents the closure of the Navy Yard in 1966 and subsequent transfer of its employees to new positions. In addition, Rudon's personnel documents and clippings about the library provide a sketch of the Technical Library's staff and work throughout the 1950s and 1960s."
