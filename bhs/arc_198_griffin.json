As a young man, Augustus owned a store and worked as a school teacher in Westchester County, N.Y. After marrying Lucretia Tuthill, with whom he had six children, Griffin moved back to Oysterponds and operated his home on Village Lane as an inn and tavern. Throughout his life, Griffin kept several diaries in which he recorded his daily life in Oysterponds, as well as the affairs of the Oysterponds and greater Long Island communities."

Griffin's diaries span the period 1792 to 1851 and record his daily activities and travels throughout Long Island and the New York City area, as well as notable local events and daily weather conditions. Griffin also makes numerous references to his fellow residents of Oysterponds and other parts of Long Island, and supplements his diaries with an index indicating the page numbers on which individual names can be found. The diaries also include references to African Americans, such as an entry about a free African American purchasing his relative's freedom. Griffin's genealogical research notes, dating from circa 1859 to 1863, are compiled in a separate volume and record marriages and deaths in the Long Island towns of Southold and Shelter Island, as well as other parts of the County and State of New York, throughout the period 1677 to 1859. The notes are also accompanied by an alphabetical index. The collection also includes a small amount of correspondence dating from 1889 to 1902 and addressed to Griffin's grandson, Chatham A. Griffin, of Hartford, CT. The letters are mostly from Justus Alonzo Griffin (b. 1846, presumably a family relative) of Hamilton, Ontario, and discuss Augustus Griffin's genealogical research."
