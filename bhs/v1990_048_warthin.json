In 1918, the family's land on Schermerhorn Street was taken by eminent domain on which the city built the Children's Court. The family then moved to Sidney Place, also in Brooklyn Heights. Virginia W. Warthin attended Brooklyn Friends School. She later married Thomas A. Warthin, a physician, and they had three sons. After retirement, the Warthins lived in Walpole, MA."
