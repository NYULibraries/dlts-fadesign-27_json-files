Two viewbooks were published by Fritschler \u0026amp; Selle in 1884 and are comprised of 23 black-and-white non-photographic prints of illustrations of views within the cemetery. The viewbooks retain their original hardcovers. Pages from one of the viewbooks have separated from the binding, and page size for both viewbooks measure 3.5\" x 5.2\". The third viewbook was published by the Photo-Engraving Company in 1891 and contains 26 black-and-white non-photographic prints of photographs showing views within the cemetery. It also retains its original hardcover, with page size measuring 5\"x 6.3\". Some of the pages have separated from the binding. The publishing information for the fourth viewbook is missing but it is assumed to also be an 1884 publication by Fritschler \u0026amp; Selle."
