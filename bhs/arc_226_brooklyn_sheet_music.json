Originally located at Broadway and 14th Street, Tin Pan Alley underwent several relocations, ultimately centering near Broadway and 49th Street, though the actual music district stretched from 42nd to 56th Streets."

The majority of the sheet music is comprised of individual publications, though a smaller portion is compiled in two bound volumes that were formerly the property of Brooklyn resident Catharine Vanderveer. A wide range of musical forms are represented in the collection, including waltzes, polkas, military marches, parade marches, religious hymns, popular songs, and other forms based upon or inspired by various musical traditions around the world. Though the majority of the song titles and lyrics are in English, some are written in French, German, Hebrew, and Italian. An inventory of the contents of Boxes 1 through 5 is contained in Box 1, while a printed card index of the contents of the collection's remaining boxes is contained in Box 10."
