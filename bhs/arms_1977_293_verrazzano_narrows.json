Construction on the bridge began in the summer of 1959 and the bridge's upper deck was opened in November of 1964. The lower deck of the bridge was completed in 1969. The construction of the bridge was the last major project overseen by New York State Parks Commissioner and Head of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, Robert Moses."
