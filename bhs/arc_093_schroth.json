From the dates provided on the versos of some prints, it is estimated that the majority of the photographs were taken during the time period circa 1840 to 1955.

Though these prints were donated by Thomas N. Schroth with all other materials in the collection, the versos of several prints attest that they originate from the Brooklyn Public Library's Brooklyn Picture Collection. The three photographs in Oversize Box 4 consist of a group picture of the Schroth family, a portrait of Frank D. Schroth, and a view of the New York City skyline.
