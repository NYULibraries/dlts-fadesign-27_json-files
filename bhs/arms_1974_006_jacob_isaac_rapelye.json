Like his father before him, Augustus was involved in the real estate business, running his own firm in New York. In 1885 he married Helen Schroeder of Woodside, the daughter of prosperous Herman Schroeder. The couple moved to Newtown village once Augustus retired from his business life in 1890, residing at the Sackett-Moore place. While in Newtown, Augustus took an active role in several local civic and church affairs. He was a member and later president of the board of education for district No. 1, and was both warden and treasurer of St. James Church in Elmhurst, which he had attended for many years. He was a trustee and member of the missionary committee of the Long Island diocese and also served its standing committee as a member and secretary. In 1898, he was a delegate to both the arch-deaconry of Queens and Nassau and the general convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in America, held in Washington, D.C. Augustus died in Newtown in 1890."
