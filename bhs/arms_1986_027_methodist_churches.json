In 1668, Methodism was introduced into what is today the borough of Brooklyn. One of the original itinerant preachers sent to the colonies, Thomas Webb, performed the first Methodist sermon in Brooklyn. It wasn't until the late 18th century that Methodist churches were established in what is today Queens (1785), Staten Island (1787), and Brooklyn (1794). The Methodist Churches of Brooklyn collection contains materials relating to seventeen Methodist churches located in Brooklyn and includes church histories, yearbooks, bulletins, invitations, directories, programs, and one scrapbook. The collection spans the years 1856 to 1978."

In 1793, due to racial discrimination within the M.E.C., the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in Philadelphia under Pastor Richard Allen. Allen then challenged in court the church's right to become an independent Wesleyan Methodist denomination and was legally granted the right by Pennsylvania courts in 1815. In 1816, under the guidance of Allen, the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church) was established in the U.S. In 1845, the M.E.C divided again over the issue of slavery. Slave holding states split from the M.E.C and formed the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. It wasn't until 1939 that the two denominations united again to form the Methodist Church. In 1968, the Methodist Church united with the Evangelical United Brethren Church (another of the original expressions of Methodism in America), forming the United Methodist Church, as it remains as of 2010."
