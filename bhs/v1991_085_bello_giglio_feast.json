In 1903, the first annual Feast of the Giglio was celebrated in the streets of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. On feast day, or Giglio Sunday (held in July), celebrants proceed through the streets following a 65 foot high Giglio tower. The immigrants who celebrated the first annual Feast of the Giglio predominantly came from the city of Nola, located in the Campania region of southern Italy, where the feast originates. As of 2011, the feast is still held at the same location in Williamsburg, centered near Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church."

The photographs show crowds watching and participating in the street procession and festival, images of the Giglio tower, and musicians performing on the tower and in the street. The collection includes three copy negatives and three duplicates of the 8 x 10 inch prints. Two of the photographs were taken by Jim Kalett, while the third photograph was donated by Thomas Bello, though the photographer is not identified."
