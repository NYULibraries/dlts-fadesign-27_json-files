Clark, and John B. Woodward. The Regiment was also in the service of New York State during the New York City draft riots of 1863. The Regiment's headquarters were based at the Brooklyn City Armory, located at Henry and Cranberry Streets. Though the Regiment was disbanded in 1898, a battalion of four companies continued to volunteer their services to the United States, going on to serve as part of the 22nd Regiment of the New York Volunteer Infantry during the Spanish-American War, and later being designated the 13th Regiment of Heavy Artillery."
