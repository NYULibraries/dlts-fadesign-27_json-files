In its first few years of existence, the Foundation operated from two houses on Carlton Avenue, which served as shelters for orphans and the elderly. In 1856, the Foundation purchased 25 lots at Albany Avenue and Herkimer Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, on which its first building was opened in 1860 as the Home for Aged and Orphans. In the ensuing decades, the Foundation expanded its services to include a medical center called St. John's Hospital, a school for nurses, and a home for the blind, which were housed at various locations to accommodate growing numbers of people in need. By the 1930s, the majority of the Foundation's services were housed at its property on Albany Avenue and Herkimer Street, which had grown into a complex of shelters and medical facilities. The exception was the Foundation's orphanage, which had moved to Sayville, Long Island in 1926 and became known as the Children's Cottages. The Foundation's complex at Albany and Herkimer Streets later became the Interfaith Medical Center, which continues to operate at the site as of 2010."
