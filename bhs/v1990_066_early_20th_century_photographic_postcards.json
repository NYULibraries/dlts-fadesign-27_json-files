One postcard shows two images of buildings on Crescent Street in the present-day Brooklyn neighborhood of New Lots (a subsection of the larger neighborhood of East New York). Shown is a view of John G. Torborg's Crescent Hotel and a view of the \"old mill\" that was located at the foot of Crescent Street. The postcard, dated 1902, relates to the Crescent Street Station of the City Line Railways (now the BMT Jamaica Line of the New York City subway) that once connected lower Manhattan, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and the resort areas of Rockaway, Queens. The second postcard is a studio portrait of two men and one woman posing in front of a railroad car backdrop, presumably taken at Coney Island, circa 1920."
