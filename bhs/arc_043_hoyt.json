Abraham Aschner opened a cigar shop in the 1880s, and at the peak of his success owned six cigar emporiums in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Aschners had six children: Herman, Isidor, Amos, Frederick B., Nathan, and Ernestine.  Ernestine Aschner married prominent Brooklyn attorney Isaac W. Jacobson in 1894, and the couple had four daughters: Madeline Jacobson-Cox, also an attorney; Juliette Jacobson-Aschner, a teacher; Jeanette Jacobson Gould; a teacher; and Alma Jacobson Hoyt. Around 1909, the Jacobson family relocated to Montgomery, in Orange County, N.Y., where Alma Jacobson married Lewis S. Hoyt in 1933. Their son was Fred Hoyt."

The bulk of images in the collection are cabinet cards from the late 19th century, with fewer items dating from the mid-20th century. Cartes-de-visite originate from Germany and depict German relatives of the Wachsmanns and Aschners, while all cabinet cards were taken in Manhattan and Brooklyn and show immediate and extended members of the Aschner and Jacobson families. A large number of portraits show of Alma Jacobson, her sisters, and her parents. The collection also contains interior shots of Abraham Aschner's cigar store on Fulton Street, both interior and exterior views of Aschner and Jacobson family homes in Brooklyn, and Alma Jacobson's 1922 drivers license issued in New York City."
