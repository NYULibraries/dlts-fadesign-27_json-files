Born in New England, French attended Brown University for one year before finding work as an engraver of silverware for the Whiting Company in Massachussetts. In 1876, French relocated to New York City and studied at the Art Students' League, where he later served as President. He was introduced to the art of bookplates by his sister-in-law, Helen Elvira Brainerd, who organized a collection of American and European ex-libris for the library of Columbia University. In addition to the over 200 bookplates French engraved and designed for collectors and institutions, French designed plates for his personal collection of international language books, with an emphasis on Volapuk, a constructed language devised in 1879 by a German priest. Among French’s work are bookplates for St. Paul's Chapel, on Lower Broadway in Manhattan; Fraunces’ Tavern, a Revolutionary War eatery and museum; and the New York Police Department’s Central Booking, known as ‘The Tombs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n                        \u003cp\u003e\n                            \u003cemph render=\"bold\"\u003eSources:\u003c/emph\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n                        \u003cp\u003e\n                            \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eThe Autobiography of Edwin Davis French\u003c/emph\u003e (1901)\u003c/p\u003e\n                        \u003cp\u003e\n                            \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eEdwin Davis French, A Memorial\u003c/emph\u003e (1906) by Mary Brainerd French\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003c/bioghist\u003e\n                \u003c/c\u003e\n                \u003cc id=\"ref34\" level=\"subseries\"\u003e\n                    \u003cdid\u003e\n                        \u003cunittitle\u003eSubseries 2: Charles W.

W. Spenceley of Boston, who has etched and engraved many notable book-plates during the last dozen years. The cottage is on a hillside, just above the quiet New Hampshire village of Chocorua…. I found him sitting beneath an apple tree, making studies of a grape vine that climbed over a boulder near by…. We passed through the spacious living-room, where hung water-colors, and prints from the book-plate work of some of the noted engravers, and continuing upstairs, reached the studio…. Mr. Spenceley placed four copper plates before me, each different in design. ‘You see the variety, but each holds my interest. Perhaps I like landscape plates best, and grace and treatment of the sixth-century French designs appeal to me especially. However, to incorporate artistically the ideas of my clientele, I find it better to use various forms of design rather than to hold to any one style’…. It is small wonder one feels the exquisite harmony in his book-plates, for he is one of Nature's most earnest lovers, and only embodies in his work the happiest and most beautiful aspects of life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003c/bioghist\u003e\n                \u003c/c\u003e\n            \u003c/c\u003e\n            \u003cc id=\"ref8\" level=\"series\"\u003e\n                \u003cdid\u003e\n                    \u003cunittitle\u003eSeries 2: Non-Illustrated Bookplates\u003c/unittitle\u003e\n                    \u003ccontainer id=\"cid1036001\" type=\"Box\" label=\"Mixed materials\"\u003eBox 10-24, 44-45\u003c/container\u003e\n                    \u003cphysdesc\u003e\n                        \u003cextent\u003e9.5 Linear feet\u003c/extent\u003e\n                        \u003cextent\u003ein 19 manuscript boxes\u003c/extent\u003e\n                    \u003c/physdesc\u003e\n                    \u003cunitdate normal=\"1701/1936\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1701-circa 1936\u003c/unitdate\u003e\n                \u003c/did\u003e\n                \u003cscopecontent id=\"ref97\"\u003e\n                    \u003chead\u003eScope and Contents\u003c/head\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eExcept where noted, these plates are mounted and do not include associated information about the subject.

Topless sirens call to distant ships on the ladies' bookplates, where the men's show shields, lions' heads and foliage.

However, these indexes are sometimes inconsistent with the physical collection at the item level. For instance, the \"Illustrated\" index lists both the owner and the engraver, and though the particular plate is indexed under \"Illustrated,\" it will be filed in the collection under the series \"Engravers of Bookplates.\" Lionel W. Rothschild is indexed under \"Illustrated,\" yet his bookplate is boxed under Sherborn (in which index Rothschild is not listed). The same is found for several other \"Illustrated\" plates, which are boxed under the engraver. Conversely, Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt is indexed in \"Illustrated\" and though engraved by Sidney L. Smith, Mrs. Roosevelt is also boxed in \"Illustrated.\" Such cross-indexing recurs in the collection, and requires the researcher to check multiple indexes and boxes before finding the physical location of a particular plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eThe J.W. Spenceley index is marked at the top in pencil, \"not in Miss Toedteberg's list,\" which description may also apply to the indexes for all engravers' collections. The French index is pencil marked to note that Emma's bookplate has been added to the collection. The Sidney L. Smith index has been previously amended in pencil where the listings are out of alphabetical order. However, the bookplates in the boxes are alphabetized according to the pre-amended indexing order, which might suggest that the author of the original index also boxed the collection.
