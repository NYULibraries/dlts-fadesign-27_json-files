Plymouth Church united with the Church of the Pilgrims in 1934 to form the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims. The Plymouth Church publications and ephemera span the period 1850 to 1963 and document the Church's administration and activities before and after its consolidation with the Church of the Pilgrims. Items include annual reports, manuals, membership lists, pamphlets, periodicals, minutes, programs, brochures, circulars, and clippings."

In 1934, it united with the neighboring Church of the Pilgrims (the former congregation of famed pastor Richard Salter Storrs) and was known afterwards as the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims. During the 1950s, when Congregational churches across America were compelled to join either one of two national denominations, the liberal United Church of Christ or the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims decided to remain independent. It then aligned itself with the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches, an organization comprised of autonomous Congregational churches. In 1961, the National Register of Historic Places deemed Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims a National Historic Landmark in recognition of its significant place in American history. As of 2010, Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims continues to serve the Brooklyn community, and its campus has grown to include five buildings: Hillis Hall (occupying the site of the Church's original edifice), the Sanctuary, a Church House, a Gymnasium, and an Arcade."
