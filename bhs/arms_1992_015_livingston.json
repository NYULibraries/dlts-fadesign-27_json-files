Andrew’s father had at least two brothers, Alexander and Daniel, and two sisters, Mary and Kate. Daniel had eight children, four daughters and four sons, including Lauchlin and John. (Lauchlin is spelled various ways in the letters, including Louchlin, Louchlan, and Lochland.) It is not clear from the letters how or when the Livingstons came to Nova Scotia, but there is no evidence of any relationship to the well-known Livingston family of Livingston Manor in the Hudson Valley and Brooklyn. This collection evidences the economic difficulties encountered by people living in Nova Scotia in the late 1800's as well as the social conditions of women and small businessmen in Brooklyn in the same time period. Following the container list are the processor’s notes about the family relationships."
