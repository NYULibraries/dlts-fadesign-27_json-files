Flatbush would later become part of Kings County (now the borough of Brooklyn) in 1664 after the British took control of New Amsterdam.  Several of Peter Lott's descendants were prominent citizens of Kings County who held influential positions in public office at the local and state levels.  The Lott family papers date from 1702 to 1954 and contain items illuminating the lives of several members of the Lott family, chiefly those of the second through eighth generations.  The collection also represents members of several families connected to the Lotts by marriage or through business and legal transactions, including the Bennit (also spelled Bennett), Bergen, Boerum, Cortelyou, Ditmas, Duryea, Everit, Hegeman, Lefferts, Livingston, Lloyd, Longmire, Ludlow, Martense, Nevins, Rapalje (also spelled Rapalye, Rapelje, and Rapelye), Remsen, Ryder, Schenck, Suydam, Terhune, Van Brunt, Vanderbilt, Vanderveer, Van Eyck, Vegte, Wyckoff, and Zabriskie families.  Materials in the collection include personal and business correspondence; legal documents, such as deeds, indentures, conveyances, and agreements; financial records; music books, scrapbooks, and sketchbooks; clippings; genealogical materials; wills; notebooks and autograph books; photographs; and various ephemera."
