In 1942, Lloyd married Carrie Orr Fleming, a teacher, who taught school for more than 30 years in New York City. He lived at 14 8th Avenue (near Flatbush Avenue) in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. Following retirement in 1959, Lloyd continued to pursue many activities and hobbies, most notably the collection and repair of antique clocks and amateur photography. Over the years, the subject of his photography was primarily historic 17th, 18th, and 19th century houses and homesteads located in the New York City metropolitan area, with many in Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island. Lloyd died in Brooklyn on May 9, 1969."
