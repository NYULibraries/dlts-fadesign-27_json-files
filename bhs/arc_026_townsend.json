The 1810 advertisement ran for four weeks and announced the sale of property on Front and Washington Streets in Brooklyn. Folder 2 contains printed facsimiles of documents pertaining land in New Utrecht inherited by Cortelyou from his father, Jaques Cortelyou, upon his death. Included are a survey of the land conducted by Jeremiah Johnson, John Lefferts, and Leffert Lefferts. Also included are a map, field notes, and statements of oath. The survey was conducted due to an \"Act to Amend\" of 1824, giving the United States exclusive jurisdiction to certain lands in New Utrecht. Timothy Cortelyou's children ultimately inherited the land and sold it for subdivision."
