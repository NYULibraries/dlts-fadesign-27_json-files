The church experienced rapid growth and underwent several expansions in the 1870s and 1880s. By 1900, Marcy Avenue Baptist Church was the largest Baptist church in Brooklyn. Materials in the collection include membership rolls, registers, and marriage stubs, as well as Deacons reports, Ladies Aid Society reports, Sunday School Superintendent reports, Benevolent Society reports, reports of the Board of Trustees, and general Church statistics."
