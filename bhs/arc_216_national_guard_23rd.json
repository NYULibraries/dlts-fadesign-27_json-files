The Regiment was mustered into United States service for the Civil War on June 16, 1863, and participated in engagements at Oyster Point and Carlisle, PA before being mustered out on July 22, 1863. The Regiment was later renamed the NYSNG 106th Infantry Regiment for service in World War I, for which it shipped to Europe in May of 1918 and participated in the Ypres-Lys and Somme Offensives, which were both successful in removing or breaking German defensive lines. The Regiment later went on to supply officers and soldiers throughout the world during World War II."

Also included are two scrapbooks of decorations, notes and correspondence, photographs, clippings, and ephemera. One scrapbook commemorates a rifle match between the NGSNY 23rd Regiment and the 13th Regiment of the Pennsylvania National Guard at Gettysburg in 1893, while the other relates to the 23rd Regiment's visit to Gettysburg in 1904. The latter scrapbook is oversized and is housed separately from the rest of the collection. Finally, the collection contains a small number of items documenting the Veteran Association of the 23rd Regiment's Company A, including a dinner and meeting announcement and a single volume containing the Association's constitution, amendments, and membership lists with autograph signatures and addresses for each member."
