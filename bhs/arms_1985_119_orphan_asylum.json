Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Society operated two institutions in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn--St. Joseph's Female Orphan Asylum on Willoughby Avenue, and St. John's Home on St. Mark's Avenue--as well as St. Paul's Industrial School on Congress and Clinton Streets in Cobble Hill, and two extension sites of the St. John's Home at Coney Island and Hicksville, N.Y. Care of children was financed by society members and Catholic church donations; the homes and school were run by members of Catholic religious orders, such as the Sisters of Charity, Sisters of St. Joseph, and Franciscan Brothers. While the Society fell under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Brooklyn, established in 1853, it appears to have operated independently of other Diocese charities until the mid-20th century."
