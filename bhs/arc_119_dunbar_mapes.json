The collection contains genealogical notes on 20 families from New York State (mostly from Suffolk County and Orange County) including four Brooklyn families: the Mapes, Vanderveers, Tuthills, and Pratts. Additionally, there are extensive reference notes citing the sources from which Mapes attained his genealogical information. Finally, the collection includes a Photostat and typescript copy of a portion of the last will and testament of Thomas Mapes of Southold, Long Island, N.Y., 1686."
