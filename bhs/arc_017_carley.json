This series also contains undated materials. Included in the series are financial records and correspondence from the Knights of Columbus, Lexington Council, No. 293 journal and publicity committee, which Carley chaired in 1928. Carley also collected newspaper clippings relating to Knights of Columbus (K of C) events, from 1923-1929. Additionally, there are programs from K of C theater events, balls, dinners, brunches and religious events that comprise the bulk of the series. The programs include local business advertisements, as well as, names of local K of C members that provide a snapshot of Greenpoint from the 1920s through the 1940s. The K of C, Lexington Council, No. 293, of which Carley was a member, sponsored many of the events noted in the programs. However, the series contains a representative sample of materials from other Brooklyn, Long Island, and New York state chapters. Carley also collected multiple issues of various K of C chapter periodical bulletins.
