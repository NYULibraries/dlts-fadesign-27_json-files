Its first permanent edifice, comprised of three buildings on Fulton, Bond, and Hanover Streets, opened in 1885 and housed the newly formed Central Branch, commonly referred to as Brooklyn Central.  At the time, the buildings were the most well-equipped YMCA facilities in the country.  By 1898, the Brooklyn YMCA had established seven branches aside from the Central Branch, including the Eastern District, Bedford, Twenty-Sixth Ward, Prospect Park, Long Island Medical College, Greenpoint, and German Branches.  The Brooklyn YMCA continued to expand throughout the 20th century, and in 1924 it was renamed the Brooklyn and Queens Young Men's Christian Association to reflect its activity in the borough of Queens.  Later in 1957, the Brooklyn and Queens YMCA became part of the YMCA of Greater New York.  As of 2011, the YMCA of Greater New York continues to serve the New York City community, with eight locations in the borough of Brooklyn."
