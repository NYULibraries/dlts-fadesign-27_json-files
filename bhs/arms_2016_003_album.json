The subjects of the photographs are chiefly domestic and leisure-related and include vacation cruises, beach outings, birthdays, children and toys, family portraits, pets, and other animals. Many of the photographs are captioned and dated and indicate that photographs were taken chiefly in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, but also in other states such as Florida and Massachussets, and in other countries, such as Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, and the Bahamas. Brooklyn locations include Coney Island, Ebbets Field, Prospect Park, and the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bay Ridge. Also included are a few news clippings relating to the marriages in 1934 of Harry C. Treber to Vera Weber and of Harold George Kraus to Helen Antoinette Janson."
