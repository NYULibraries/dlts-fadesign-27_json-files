As a child, Ludlow went to live with Edward Augustus Caner and his wife Cornelia (nee Vermilye) in Brooklyn, N.Y. Caner was an accountant and amateur photographer, and Ludlow was the subject of many of his photographs. Ludlow attended seminary at the Episcopal Theological School (now the Episcopal Divinity School) in Cambridge, MA and became a priest. In this capacity, he served as a missionary in China, circa 1914 to 1915. Ludlow also attended Columbia University where he studied law. Ludlow went on to become Bishop of Newark, N.J. from 1936 to 1953. He married Helen Roosevelt Lincoln (1890-1985) on June 11, 1911 in Cambridge, MA and they had at least three sons."
