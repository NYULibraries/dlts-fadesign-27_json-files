Construction began in 1866 and continued into the 1870s. The park's design included a meadow, wooded ravine, and lake. Prospect Park was immensely popular upon opening, and attracted visitors from across the social classes. The park's rural scenery and recreation areas were supplemented by new features such as a zoo and playgrounds in the early 20th century. As of 2011, Prospect Park is one of the largest parks in Brooklyn and receives over eight million visitors each year."
