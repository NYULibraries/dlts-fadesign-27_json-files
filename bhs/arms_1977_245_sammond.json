Materials represented in the collection include correspondence, scrapbooks, clippings, writings, scores, sheet music, concert programs, and one black and white photograph of Sammond. Materials relating to the Morning Choral Society, Clinton Avenue Congregational Church, and the Middle Collegiate Church are included in the collection. Further, Sammond's own musical compositions and arrangements can also be found in the collection."

During World War I he acquired a military job as the Song Leader of forts in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Rockaway County. He granted private music lessons and served as conductor of several choral organizations, including the Flushing Oratorio, the Elizabeth (New Jersey) Oratorio Society, the Apollo Men's Club of Asbury Park (New Jersey), and most famously of all, the Morning Choral Society of Brooklyn. The Morning Choral Society was founded in 1919 by Sammond as a women's amateur vocal group. Over the years it gained an esteemed reputation among the churchgoing citizens of Brooklyn, and his retirement from the group in 1949 met with fanfare and local media attention. The Morning Choral Society eventually disbanded in 1962, two years before Sammond's death."

They consist of two scrapbooks and a folder of newspaper and magazine clippings--all of which are in fragile condition. The clippings offer a wide-ranging view of the local media attention garnered by Sammond and his musical activities over the decades. Clippings are also present in the two scrapbooks. Scrapbook 1 is a bound volume with recital and church programs, as well as a pictorial list of churches at which Sammond served as organist and choirmaster. Scrapbook 2 is unbound and primarily commemorates Sammond's 1949 retirement from the Morning Choral Society.

In this series a distinction is made between original, handwritten scores and printed sheet music; it is arranged according to these two formats and sub-arranged alphabetically by the titles of Sammond's individual compositions. The compositions themselves are original works in certain ways: in some instances Sammond appropriates a poem or a set of lyrics authored by someone else and scores his own music to the words. In other instances he composes a unique arrangement of the work of another composer. All the scores are undated, but when both a score(s) and sheet music exist for a single composition, the corresponding date is provided on account of the copyright on the sheet music.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/scopecontent\u003e\n            \u003c/c\u003e\n        "
