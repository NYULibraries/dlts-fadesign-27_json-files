The Hospital's first building was constructed on an area bounded by Canton Street, DeKalb Avenue, and Raymond Street and opened in 1852. As the Hospital grew throughout the ensuing decades, its original building expanded into a sprawling complex of medical facilities. In 1880, the Hospital established Brooklyn's first nurse training school, which came to be known as the Brooklyn Training School for Nurses. In 1982, the Brooklyn Hospital merged with the Caledonian Hospital and was renamed the Brooklyn Hospital-Caledonian Hospital. This name was later changed to the Brooklyn Hospital Center in 1990, and as of 2011 the Hospital continues to operate under this most recent name."

The majority of the collection consists of the Hospital's annual reports, as well as annual reports of the Brooklyn Training School for Nurses. Additional items include various progress reports, newsletters, brochures, calendars, periodicals, and a subscription book dating from the founding of the Hospital."
