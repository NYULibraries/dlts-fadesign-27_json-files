First settled by the Dutch in the 1630s, Flatbush was granted a patent of township by Governor Peter Stuyvesant in 1652. Flatbush came under British rule when the British invaded New Amsterdam (now New York City) in 1664. During the 1670s, Flatbush fell back under Dutch control for a short time before returning again to British rule. The Town of Flatbush was annexed by the City of Brooklyn in 1894 and the City of Brooklyn was then incorporated into New York City in 1898. For most of its history, Flatbush was a rural community, populated with farms. Today, Flatbush is a neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn and is comprised of numerous smaller neighborhoods including Midwood, Ditmas Park, Fiske Terrace, Beverly Square (East and West), Prospect Park South, Caton Park, and Albemarle-Kenmore Terraces."
