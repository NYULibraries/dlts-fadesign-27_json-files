Teale (b. 1843) was a Brooklyn clothier who served as city magistrate for the City of Brooklyn and later as city magistrate for New York City following consolidation. Teale was born in Nottingham, England on June 1, 1843. He immigrated to Brooklyn when he was six years old and lived in Brooklyn for the remainder of his life. He attended Public School 8 but left school when he was 12 years old to work as an errand boy in the Young Men's Christian Association (Y.M.C.A.). From ages 14 to 18 he worked in the carpentry trade, leaving that trade to then work as a salesman at Henry and John Paret's wholesale clothing house. In 1871, Teale partnered with F.T. Hoyt to start Hoyt \u0026amp; Teale, a retail clothing business. Three years later, he opened his own merchant tailor business, Teale \u0026amp; Co., located at 611 Fulton Street. Teale was appointed a member of the Board of Education by Brooklyn Mayor James Howell, a positon he was reappointed to numerous times. He was also a member of the board of directors of the Y.M.C.A., a member of the Oxford Club, and a member of the Hanson Place M.E. Church, among other activities."
