The Fulton Street building expanded as Namm's business grew into a department store in the early 20th century, eventually covering most of the block and becoming the flagship store of A. I. Namm \u0026amp; Son Department Store. In 1957, the Fulton Street complex of A.I. Namm \u0026amp; Son Department Store closed. The existing portion of the Namm building, 450-458 Fulton Street at the corner of Hoyt Street, received landmark status in 2005."
