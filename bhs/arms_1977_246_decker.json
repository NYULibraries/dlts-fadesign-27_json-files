Louie, named after an aunt, studied piano and went on to become a noted concert pianist in the New York City area. In 1865, the Ray family moved to Brooklyn where Dr. Ray continued to practice medicine. Louie married George M. Decker (1825-1927) in 1869 and they had one daughter, Josie Ray Decker (circa 1870-1964). Josie, a Brooklyn native, was a long-time resident of the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. She lived on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights until her death in 1964."
