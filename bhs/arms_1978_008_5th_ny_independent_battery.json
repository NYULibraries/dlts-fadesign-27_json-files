Taft, was active in several major battles throughout the War, including Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Gettysburg, and was also active in Philip Sheridan's campaign in the Shenandoah. After the expiration of its term in 1864, the Battery remained in service until it was honorably discharged on July 6, 1865. Certain surviving members of the Battery, including private (and later 2nd lieutenant) William H. Cornell, became members of the Brooklyn-based George C. Strong Post No. 534 of the Grand Army of the Republic, a national association of Union Army veterans."

The October 1863 muster documents the presence in camp of African-Americans as servants to the battery's officers.

The roster, dating from circa 1910, contains a list of Post officers; a Roll of Honor listing deceased members, along with dates of death and places of burial; a list of active members; and bylaws. Additional handwritten notes indicating changes to the roster through circa 1912 are also filed throughout the booklet."
