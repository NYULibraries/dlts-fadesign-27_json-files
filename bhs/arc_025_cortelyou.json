He was born in Brooklyn in 1796 as the third child of Peter J. and Phebe H. (Voorhees) Cortelyou. During the War of 1812 he served as a private in the 64th Regiment of the New York Militia. He married Ann Maria Fowler in April of 1830, and over the course of their marriage the couple had three children. Cortelyou was the last member of his family to reside at the historic Old Stone House (commonly known as \"the Cortelyou house\") at Gowanus. The Jacques Cortelyou papers span the period 1706 to 1898 and consist chiefly of business, legal and financial records, many of which pertain to Cortelyou's farm at Gowanus and serve to illuminate the inheritance of the Old Stone House. The remaining portion of the collection consists of a small amount of genealogical material pertaining to the Cortelyou family, and various other papers."

Some of these documents serve to illuminate the inheritance of the Old Stone House, such as excerpts from the last wills and testaments of Nicholas Veghte and Jaques Cortelyou (Jacques Cortelyou's grandfather) that concern the inheritance of the property, and the deed of sale of the Old Stone House from Nicholas Cowenhoven to the elder Jaques Cortelyou. The majority of the documents, however, are tax receipts, property assessments, and ledger sheets. There are also bonds, agreements, and indentures for land sold to Clarence Sackett and Orlando C. Osborne by Jacques Cortelyou. The land sold to Sackett is located on Navy, Wallabout, and Tillary Streets. The remaining portion of the collection consists of a small amount of genealogical material pertaining to the Cortelyou family, a miscellaneous receipt, an honorable discharge from the First Regiment of the Horse Artillery of the New York Militia, a Report of the Treasurer of the Brooklyn Female Academy (later the Packer Collegiate Institute), a description of land owned by a William Barkelo, and a document articulating the conditions of sale for the estate of Harmanes Barkelo (in which Jacques Cortelyou's father, Peter, seems to have played a role). Not all items in the collection are dated, so there is a small chance the aforementioned date range is not entirely conclusive."
