A new chapel was erected in 1885, located at Lee Avenue and Keap Street in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 1910, the church absorbed members of the Central Baptist Church of Williamsburg who had originally split off from First Baptist 50 years earlier. Members of the First Free Baptist Church of Brooklyn also migrated to the church in 1915. The First Baptist Church of Williamsburg closed in 1939, at which time most active members joined Emmanuel Baptist Church in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn."

Membership rolls are indexed and also have an accompanying volume listing marriages in the church, linking female members' maiden and married names. Also included are a catalog of the Sunday School library, a 50th anniversary booklet, and three photographs which show the interior and exterior of the church."
