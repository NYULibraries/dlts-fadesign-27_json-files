Smith, who pursued her interest in genealogy research after retiring from her position as Deputy Librarian of the New York Municipal Reference Library in 1970. While indexing the records of St. Paul's Church in Flatbush, Smith became interested in Matthews, whose distinguished career as a bookbinder appealed to her. Smith subsequently set out to compose a biography of Matthews, along with a history and genealogy of his family. Rather than seeking to publish her work, Smith donated her typescript and research notes to the Brooklyn Historical Society. In her later life she lived in Sarasota, FL."
