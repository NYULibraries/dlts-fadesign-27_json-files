The newsletters include copies of the IHB News, circa 1940-1949; The Light Buoy, 1938, 1944; and The Reporter, 1953. These newsletters highlight accomplishments of the Home, services offered to clients, client success stories, and general issues of concern to blind people. One of the informational booklets is dated 1933 and was published in celebration of the Home's 40th anniversary; the other was published circa 1930 to 1950 and provides general information on the services offered by the Home."
