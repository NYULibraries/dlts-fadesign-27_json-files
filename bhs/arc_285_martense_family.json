The bulk of the documents date from the 1700s to circa 1876. The images date from circa 1870 to circa 1944. Deeds and other land transaction documents dating from the 1700s comprise the largest portion of the collection. The Martense family lived in Flatbush, now part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, and most of the collection concerns that area. Correspondence in the collection dates from 1837-1839 and includes several letters sent to Gerrit Martense at Rutgers College in New Brunswick, N.J., by his family in Flatbush. Subjects of the letters include domestic and local matters. The letters, and other documents in the collection, also refer to dealings concerning one Juan Scorsur, an Italian immigrant to New York attempting to acquire real estate in Brooklyn while residing for an extended time in Cuba. In addition to multiple generations of Martenses, among the surnames found in the collection are Cornell, Hegeman, Lefferts, Remsen, Suydam, Terhune, Van Brunt, Van der Bilt, Van der Veer, and Waldron. The bulk of the collection is in English, but there are several documents in Dutch and one in Spanish. The photographs and other images, to the extent they are identified, are principally of members of the Wilbur family, into which a Martense married."

Miss Wilbur died in 1930. After Miss McKee died in 1973 the collection went to her niece, Mrs. Merle McKillop and, at her death, to another niece, Mrs. Woonton. After unsuccessful attempts to pass the papers on to Miss Wilbur's remaining relations, Mrs Woonton gave the collection to Mrs. Dorothy P. Truman of Morristown, N.J., for an appropriate disposition. Mrs. Truman identified Brooklyn Historical Society for the donation."

They were descendants of Marten Adrianse (or Adriaence) (1668-1754), the second son of Adrian Ryerson. Just as Marten was known as Adrianse (child of Adrian) from his father's name, similarly, in the next generation, Marten's second son took the name Gerrit Martense (1697-1732). Subsequent generations of sons into the early 1800s retained the surname Martense, though with some variant spellings, and the first names Gerrit and Leffert appear often in this family line. Their wives came from the families Vanderbilt, Suydam, Cortelyou, Vanderveer, and Ditmas. Gerrit Martense (1823-1849) and Jane A. Ditmas had a daughter, Jane V. Martense (1846-1912), who married Lionel Wilbur (d. 1880?). Their daughter, Anna M. Wilbur (d. 1930) came into possession of these papers.
