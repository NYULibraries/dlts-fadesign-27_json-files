The purpose of these clubs was to officially endorse the Party's nominees for office and campaign on their behalf during election season, as well as to turn out the vote in their respective wards on election day. In 1868, ward-level campaign clubs were organized in the city of Brooklyn on behalf of Republican presidential and vice-presidential nominees Ulysses S. Grant and Schuyler Colfax; in 1870 they were organized on behalf of Republican gubernatorial nominee Stewart L. Woodward and his running mate Sigismund Kaufman; and in 1872, ward-level campaign clubs were organized on behalf of incumbent Republican presidential nominee Ulysses S. Grant and his running mate, Henry Wilson."
