While the legislature passed the application and issued the company a charter, a confusion over the terms of the charter led to the share money being returned with interest and the folding of the company. However, the company was revived in 1847 when it was taken over by Philadelphia investors. Alden Spooner died in 1848, and Robert Nichols was elected to head the company. By 1852 over 22 miles of mains had been erected, along with 1,200 lamps. Upon Nichols's retirement in January of 1862, the company had surplusses from its earnings despite the efforts of the rival Citizens' Gas Light Company. In 1895 the Brooklyn Gas Light Company consolidated with five other gas lighting companies, including the Citizens' Gas Light Company, to form the Brooklyn Union Gas Company."
