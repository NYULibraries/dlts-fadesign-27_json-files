The club house moved in 1881, to the foot of 55th Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park, and again in 1898 to Sea Gate, at the western end of Coney Island. After a club house fire in 1933, the Atlantic Yacht Club fell into inactivity before being revived in the early 21st century by a new generation of sailing enthusiasts."
