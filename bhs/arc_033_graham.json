The collection spans the years 1806-1965. Augustus Graham, born Richard King in Modbury, Devon, England, was the son of John King and Mary King (nee Barrons). Modbury Parish Records list his baptism as April 15, 1776. It is unclear when Richard King began calling himself Augustus Graham. Also around 1808, Graham formed a business partnership with John Bell. Bell, a Scotsman originally from Northern Ireland, also adopted the surname of Graham. By 1822, Augustus and John had started the Brooklyn White Lead Company."
