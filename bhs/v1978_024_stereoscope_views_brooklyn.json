Stereographs are double photographic prints that are mounted on sturdy cards to be placed into a stereoscope for viewing. Although early stereoscopy dates back to the 1830s, it did not become popular until the 1850s when a simpler and more accessible stereoscopic viewer was invented by Scottish scientist, David Brewer."
