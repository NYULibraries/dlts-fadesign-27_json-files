Business papers pertain to Michael Shellens's careers in seafaring and real estate, and personal papers pertain to the private affairs of the Shellens family.  The books are from the personal collections of members of the Shellens family.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBusiness papers include discharge documents received at destination ports, business and financial records, accounts and service agreements, calculation and log books, bills, and correspondence compiled during Shellens's many sailing trips.

The correspondence includes letters between Shellens and his daughter Ruth from her childhood to womanhood, and letters from Shellens's mentor and friend Captain George Wilson, as well as letters between Shellens and other colleagues and friends.  Other correspondence pertains to Shellens's brother, M. Henry Shellens, and his cousins in Antwerp.  These letters refer to the well-being of family members, requests for funds, Shellens's mother's death, and Shellens's own ill health in the 1940s.  Correspondence of Shellens's wife, Ella (Collamore) Shellens, including a letter of condolence from Captain Wilson's wife after the death of the Shellens' first child, Marie, is also present here. Other personal papers include materials related to the wedding of Michael and Ella Shellens, birth records for Ruth Shellens, obituaries of family members, employment letters, certificates, property ownership papers, professional and social affiliation materials, and materials relating to Michael and Ella Shellens's marriage and deaths, such as a wedding announcement, funeral memoirs, wills, bank balances, real estate holdings, and certificates.

The majority of the photographs are portraits, though there are some candid shots as well.  Nearly half of the photographs are of Michael Shellens and his immediate family in Brooklyn, while the rest depict members of the extended Shellens family, many of whom seem to be from the Shellens family in Antwerp.  The majority of the individuals from the extended Shellens family are unidentified, though some photographs do provide identifications on their versos.  There is also a small number of photographs pertaining to Michael Shellens's seafaring and real estate careers. Several different types of photographic media are contained in this series, including cartes-de-visite, cabinet cards, and tintypes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e"
