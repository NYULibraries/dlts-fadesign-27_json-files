The view book was published by Frederick F. Purdy, a real estate agent, surveyor, and conveyancer, for the purpose of promoting real estate located in Centre Moriches for sale or for rent, as well as to promote the quality of life of Centre Moriches as a residential destination. The viewbook contains images of hotels, churches, and pastoral and beach views, as well as informational and historical descriptions of the area. A Long Island Railroad time table between Long Island City in Queens, N.Y. and Centre Moriches is also included. The pages of the viewbook are brittle and have separated from the binding."
