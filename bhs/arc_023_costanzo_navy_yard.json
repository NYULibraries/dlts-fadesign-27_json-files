Historic vessels constructed or launched at the Navy Yard include Robert Fulton's steam frigate, the \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eFulton\u003c/emph\u003e, the USS \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eArizona\u003c/emph\u003e, the USS \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eMissouri\u003c/emph\u003e, and the USS \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eAntietam\u003c/emph\u003e. During the Civil War, the Navy Yard employed about 6,000 people. By 1938, it provided jobs for over 10,000 people. When the Defense Department ceased shipbuilding activities at the Navy Yard in 1966, 88 vessels had been manufactured at the facility. It had also grown to encompass 291 acres with 270 major buildings, 24 miles of railroad tracks, 23,278 linear feet of crane tracks, 18 miles of paved roads, 16,495 feet of berthing space, 9 piers, 6 dry docks, and 22 shops housing 98 different trades. In 1967, the Brooklyn Navy Yard was acquired by the City of New York and was converted for private commercial use."
