He served as president of the Metropolitan Retail Florists' Association and was a trustee of the New York Florists' Club. Gross was particularly active in veterans' welfare work and was a leader in the Kings County American Legion, the Democratic Veterans Organization, and the Hospitalized American Servicemen's Committee. He died in 1959 in a veterans' hospital in Brooklyn and was survived by his widow, Lillian, his sister, Mrs. Anna Edwards, and his brother, Sol."

The photographs appear to be chiefly the work of professional photographers working for local newspapers or the Armed Forces Public Information Office. The photographs appear to capture events relating to Adolph Gross' charitable work on behalf of veterans as a member of the Hospitalized Service Men's Committee and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (March of Dimes). Such events include observation of May 19th, Armed Services Day, and a Veterans Day baseball celebration at Ebbets Field on June 11, 1953. Subjects of photographs include civilians participating in such charitable work, servicemen and women, and floral arrangements."
