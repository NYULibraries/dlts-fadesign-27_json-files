Compilers of the scrapbooks include Josephine C. Frost, Spencer Hoag, Helen Cory Mercier, and Herman Nickerson, though the origins of the majority of the scrapbooks are unknown. Materials in the scrapbooks include clippings and obituaries (many from the \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eBrooklyn Daily Eagle\u003c/emph\u003e newspaper), programs, pamphlets, menus, magazines, invitations and announcements, press releases, theater playbills, poems, postcards, illustrations, cartoons, and photographs.
