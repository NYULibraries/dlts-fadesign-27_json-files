The photographs relate to the Society's historic building, as well as the activities of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society). The collection is comprised of black-and-white photographic prints, color photographic prints, contact sheets, and contact sheet negatives. The photographs were created by both professional and amateur photographers including Ernest Tanare, Ellis Herwig, Henrik Krogius, and Alan Kritzler, among others, while the creator is unknown for the remaining photographs in the collection. A large portion of photographs in the collection focus on exterior, interior, and detail views of the landmarked LIHS building. The collection also documents activities of the Society--such as exhibitions, tours, and events--held at LIHS from the 1950s through 1970s. Both black-and-white and color images document LIHS exhibitions, LIHS staff, group tours at LIHS, as well as the speakers and attendees of events held at LIHS."
