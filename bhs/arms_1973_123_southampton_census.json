Recorded in the back of the volume is summary information listing the total number of freeholders and non-freeholders living in Southampton; the total acreage of occupied improved land; the total number of cattle, sheep, and horses owned by town residents; the total quantity (in yards) of flannel, linen and woolen cloths produced in Southampton; and the total number of grist mills, fulling mills, saw mills, carding machines and cotton and woolen factories in operation at the time the census was recorded."
