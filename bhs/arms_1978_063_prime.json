Prime entered the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1801, graduated in 1804, and was licensed to preach in the Presbytery of Long Island on October 10, 1805. In addition to preaching in churches throughout the Northeast, Prime was a published writer, a trustee of Middlebury and Williams Colleges, and an early leader of the temperance movement on Long Island. He is buried with his wife at the Evergreens Cemetery in Brooklyn."
