Originally signed to the Dodgers minor league team, the Montreal Royals, in October of 1945, Robinson was brought up to the majors in 1947, where he subsequently earned the Rookie of the Year award that same year. Although the team played in the World Series nine times, they won the World Series only once in 1955. Regardless, the teams' fans were nearly as renowned at the team itself, known for their antics and loyalty. In 1958, the Brooklyn Dodgers became the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ebbets Field was demolished in 1960."

The collection also includes a photographic portrait of pitcher Hank Casey; a team photograph of the Dodgers in front of Borough Hall in Brooklyn after winning the National League pennant in 1949; and a photograph of Dodgers' fans waiting on line to buy tickets for the World Series after the Dodgers won the National League pennant in 1956."
