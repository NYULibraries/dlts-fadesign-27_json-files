The aim of the Association's work was to improve the physical and moral condition of Brooklyn's poor population. Its early services included the distribution of alms, food, and clothing, as well as the providing of employment. As the Association grew, it extended its services and established specialized departments, including a school for the blind, an orthopedic ward, health and dental centers, and a home-making center. The Association also published \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eThe Brooklyn Charities Record and Directory\u003c/emph\u003e, which included information about charitable activities in Brooklyn and contained listings of other charitable organizations."
