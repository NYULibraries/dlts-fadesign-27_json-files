Much of the material concerns Kings County (N.Y.), especially New Utrecht (now part of Brooklyn), but New Jersey and other locales also appear in the genealogical documents. Many of the letters are from John Van Brunt (1802-1880) of Englewood, N.J.; these typically concern genealogy and family history, but some also include his perspectives on politics, the development of Englewood, and local issues such as a controversy over racially segregated schools. The legal documents include deeds, wills, and slave bills of sale."

John and Margaret lived in a village in Bergen County in what was then called English Neighborhood; in 1859 that village took a new name, Englewood. John was an organizer and officer of the Northern Railroad, which in the 1850s extended the train running from Jersey City to English Neighborhood on to the New York State line. John was a member of the Democratic Party and a state senator for two terms. Among other positions, he was Englewood's Town Superintendent for Education for 20 years. His father was Cornelius Van Brunt (1760-1827), who married Jannetie Adriance. Adriance was the name given to one of John and Margaret's sons; Adriance became an architect and some stationery with his letterhead is in the collection, used by John for his correspondence.

There are several other wills, deeds, indentures, and the like in the collection. Some of the other surnames appearing in the legal documents are Debevoise, Denyse, and Lefferts.
