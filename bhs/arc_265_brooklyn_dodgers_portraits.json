In 1913, the team moved to a new home field, Ebbets Field, and the next year hired Manager Wilbert Robinson (hence the name the Brooklyn Robins) who would become the winningest manager in the teams' history. After 18 years at the helm, Robinson retired as manager in 1931. The following year, in 1932, the team officially became the Brooklyn Dodgers and remained so until the end of 1957 season, when the team was moved to Los Angeles."
