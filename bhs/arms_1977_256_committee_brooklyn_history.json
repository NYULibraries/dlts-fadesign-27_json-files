Wurster, the Committee on Brooklyn History was established under the supervision of the Long Island Historical Society (now Brooklyn Historical Society) and was chaired by Tunis G. Bergen. The Committee on Brooklyn History records span the years 1897 to 1920 (bulk dates 1897 to 1909) and measure 2.09 linear feet. Materials represented in the collection include minutes, financial records, reports, correspondence, and lists of historical manuscripts and documents consulted during the project. The collection documents the activities of the Committee, as well as the research activities and expenditures of both Sydney Reid and Arthur James Weise, who were hired for the project."

On March 25, 1903 Reid was rehired to continue his work on the project. In July of 1904, the Committee also hired Arthur James Weise to locate, compile, and translate early Dutch manuscripts, documents, and rare books relating to the history of Brooklyn. Weise spent much of his time in the state archives located in Albany, N.Y. Weise continued to work on the project through 1910."
