Cruikshank (b. 1892)and organized by subject matter. Subjects include banks, mayors, the military, transportation, recreations, prominent Brooklyn citizens and organizations, the Capitoline Grounds on Bedford Avenue, the neighborhood of East New York, and the East Reformed Presbyterian Church, among others. Also included are materials relating to Reuben S. and Sarah A. Decker. Reuben S. Decker (1830-1911) was partners with Hamilton Weed in the Capitoline Grounds, which were located on Decker's land, once the estate of the prominent Lefferts family of Brooklyn. One of Decker's daughters was Laura Cruikshank, who was probably Ruth D. Cruikshank's mother. Items pertaining to the Decker family include a journal, legal papers from a dispute between the Decker and Brevoort families, receipts, tax bills, and certificates. The collection spans the period 1863 to 1945."
