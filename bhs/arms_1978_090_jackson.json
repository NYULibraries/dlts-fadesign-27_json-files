In 1881, Jackson was appointed Registar of Arrears by Brooklyn Mayor Seth Low, and in 1889 he was elected Comptroller. He was also Director of the First National Bank of the City of Brooklyn, the Williamsburgh Trust Co., the Long Island Loan and Trust Co., and the New York and East River Ferry Co., of which he was also President. He was also a member of the Sons of the Revolution and the Hamilton and Hanover Clubs. Jackson retired in 1893."
