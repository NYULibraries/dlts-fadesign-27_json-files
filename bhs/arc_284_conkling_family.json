Siding with the rebels during the American Revolution, Conkling spent time in prison during the war. He died in 1787. Judging from the correspondence in the collection written from Guilford, Connecticut, Jacob was a \"refugee\" from the British occupation of Long Island."

An undated journal describes Jacob's travels through northern New Jersey and into the forests of either Pennsylvania or New York beyond the Delaware Water Gap.
