In addition to the photographs, the collection contains genealogical records and two items relating to public schools in Lansingburgh, New York: a primary school class portrait (circa 1880s) and an autograph book (1890-1892), which features the signature of W.E.B. Du Bois. The Wibecan family originated from St. Croix and England, before settling in Brooklyn and becoming prominent members of the local Black community."
