His father, Frederick D. Hart, was chief engineer of Ridgewood Water Works. Edith then became a music teacher in the public schools and retired in 1921. Her son, Ronald Hart, attended Manual Training High School and was a member of the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I. In the 1920s he married Virigina Packard, a librarian, writer, and interior designer. She operated shops out of the Hotel Bossert and on the north shore of Long Island. The Virginia M. Packard Hart Scholarship was established at Pratt Institute in her memory."
