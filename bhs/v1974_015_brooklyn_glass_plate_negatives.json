The negatives are a mix of anonymous creations, reproductions, and original photography by Henry O. Korten. Images in the collection show rural Brooklyn life, street scenes, snowstorms, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard (formally known as the New York Naval Shipyard) in the late 19th century. Locations featured include the neighborhoods of Flatlands, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn Heights, as well as Prospect Park and the East River waterfront. Two portraits of Native Americans and snowstorm scenes located in the Flushing neighborhood of Queens are also included. Prints from a select number of glass plate negatives are also available."
