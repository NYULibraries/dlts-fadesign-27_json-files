The Home was originally located at 219 Raymond Street, and subsequently moved to a new building on Kingston Avenue in 1887, where the Home would remain until it closed in 1955. In 1956, the Brooklyn Thoracic Hospital merged with the Brooklyn Hospital, bringing the staff and trustees of both institutions together under one roof. As of 2010, the Brooklyn Hospital is still in operation and is known as the Brooklyn Hospital Center."
