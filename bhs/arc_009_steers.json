The bulk of the collection pertains to Steers' position as a jurist, to his activity in the Kings County Volunteer Firemen's Association, and to his service in the 14th Regiment of the National Guard of New York State. The scrapbook of news clippings documenting Steers' career as a judge records the individual cases he presided over, often in great detail."
