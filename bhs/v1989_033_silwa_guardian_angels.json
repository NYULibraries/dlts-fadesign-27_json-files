Also known under the moniker the \"Red Berets\" for their easily recognizable red hats, the \"Magnificent 13\" quickly expanded during the early 1980s, gaining more members and changing their name to the \"Guardian Angels.\" As the Guardian Angels, the organization grew its safety patrols throughout the city and gained world wide notoriety. As of 2011, the Guardian Angels have 140 chapters in 15 countries, with services and programs ranging from safety patrols, to educational programs, to an internet safety program. Concurrent with his leadership as the Director of the Guardian Angels, Sliwa is also a radio host."
