Smith's great grandson, Caleb Smith (1724-1800), was a graduate of Yale College and a judge for the Suffolk County Court of Common Pleas, as well as a member of the New York State Assembly. In 1754, Caleb and his father, Daniel Smith II, built a home on the estate of Richard Smith, in which Caleb lived with his wife, Martha (b. 1727), and their four children. Five subsequent generations of the Smith family resided on the estate until 1888, when it was purchased by the Brooklyn Gun Club. In 1963, the State of New York acquired the Smith estate and converted it into part of the Caleb Smith State Park Preserve. As of 2011, Caleb Smith's original house still stands as part of the preserve."

The papers represent various members of the Smith families, particularly William Smith of the Manor of St. George and Caleb Smith of Smithtown, as well as Richard (the founder of Smithtown), Joshua, Ebenezer, and Obadiah Smith, among others. A military commission bestowing the rank of Ensign to Caleb Smith, Jr. (b. 1763) in Captain Joshua Smith, Jr.'s Company of Light Infantry in the Militia of Suffolk County is also included."
