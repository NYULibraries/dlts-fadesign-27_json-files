The viewbooks contain views of Coney Island including images of attractions, buildings, and structures at Luna Park and Dreamland, street scenes of Surf Avenue, as well as group portraits of people on the beach at Coney Island and images of people attending the attractions at Coney Island. The original softcovers of both viewbooks have been recovered with hardcover library bindings which are now brittle, and pages from the viewbooks have separated from the bindings. The viewbook printed in 1905 contains 30 pages and its page size is 7.75 x 10.30, while the viewbook printed in 1909 contains 28 pages with its page size measuring 8 x 10 inches. Digital versions of the images from the viewbooks are available via the image database located in the library."
