By 1647, the Dutch were calling the area Nieuw Amersfoort (New Amersfoort). In 1661, New Netherland Director-General Peter Stuyvesant granted New Amersfoort the right to local rule. By 1664, the British had taken control of New Netherland and changed the name of New Amersfoort to Flatlands. The Supervisor of the Town of Flatlands account books, measuring .14 linear feet in three volumes, span the years 1817 to 1886. Entries in all volumes record the name of the Supervisor, the amount of money received, date received, what the money was received for, and the signature of the payee."
