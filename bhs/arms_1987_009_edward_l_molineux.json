These bound documents about Edward L. Molineux’s experiences in the Civil War were compiled by Cecil Molineux in order to benefit his grandchildren. The rest of the collection of memorabilia pertains to Molineux’s life after the war. There is no indication of who collected them. These papers represent a well written candid account of the social, emotional, and strategic aspects of the Civil War. Included in the collection is a letter from the city of Augusta, Georgia to Molineux dated 1865, thanking him upon his retirement of his post for his intelligent and compassionate command of the city during the war."
