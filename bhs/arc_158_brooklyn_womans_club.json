Women's societies and clubs sprang up throughout what today comprises the five boroughs of New York City and ranged from the most exclusive to the most inclusive. The Brooklyn Woman's Club, organized in 1869 and incorporated in 1871, was a non-sectarian, apolitical organization whose mission was to support the personal development of its members, thus improving society and humanity as a whole. The Brooklyn Woman's Club collection includes yearbooks for the years 1903 to 1943, as well as additional calendars and membership nominations. "

Each entry recorded the name of each member, the year they joined the Club, and their home address.
