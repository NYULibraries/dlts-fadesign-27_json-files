Buckley's appeal was answered by prominent banker George Ingraham Seney, who contributed $100,000 and several plots of land to begin construction of the hospital, and to incorporate the institution. The hospital was incorporated on May 27, 1881, and opened on December 19, 1887 at the corner of 6th Street and 7th Avenue in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. Originally housed in three buildings with a staff of 16, Methodist Episcopal Hospital grew steadily throughout the 20th century, and as of 2010 it comprises a sprawling complex of buildings with a staff of several hundred. In the 1990s, the institution's name was officially changed to New York Methodist Hospital."
