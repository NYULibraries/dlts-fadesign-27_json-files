The minutes provide a glimpse of the Urban Club's primary activities and interests, including the speakers it hosted, the philanthropic causes it supported, and the current events that were of concern at different times during its existence. The meeting minutes also include the names of club members and meeting attendees, and document the elections of club officers as well as approval of new members. Also included in the collection are two scrapbooks of newspaper clippings and other ephemera that further document the Club's activities, and some publications of the New York and Long Island Federation of Women's Clubs, of which the Urban Club was a member. One of the scrapbooks is oversized and is housed separately from the rest of the collection."
