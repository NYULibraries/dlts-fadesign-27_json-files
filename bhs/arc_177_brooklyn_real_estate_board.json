The Board also issued two monthly news publications: \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eBrooklyn Realty Magazine\u003c/emph\u003e, the first issue of which was published in May of 1926, and \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eRealty Facts\u003c/emph\u003e, a bulletin that was first issued in June of 1947.
