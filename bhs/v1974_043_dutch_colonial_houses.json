Dutch colonial houses in Brooklyn are identifiable by their gambrel roofs (typically a symmetrical two-sided roof consisting of two slopes), curved projecting eaves, end chimneys, shingled siding, and south facing entrances. As of 2011, several examples of Dutch colonial houses remain in Brooklyn, including the Hendrick I. Lott House located at 1940 East 36th Street in the Marine Park neighborhood, the Pieter Lefferts House now located in Prospect Park (originally located on Flatbush Avenue near Maple Street in what today would be the Prospect Lefferts Garden neighborhood), and the Pieter Claeson Wyckoff House located at 5816 Clarendon Road at Ralph Avenue in the neighborhood of East Flatbush. All houses are landmarked, while the Wyckoff house holds the distinction as the first building in New York City to be landmarked."
