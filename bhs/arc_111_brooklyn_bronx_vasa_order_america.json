The organization was named after the Vasa family of the Swedish royal line that founded the modern state of Sweden in the 16th century and established Lutheranism as the state religion under Gustav Vasa (1496-1560), the first King of Sweden, elected in 1523.  The bulk of the collection is comprised of minutes of lodge meetings, lodge membership records, yearly and twice-yearly financial reports from the individual lodges, and ephemera, covering the period 1906 to 1982, with the bulk of the material spanning the 1920s to the 1970s.  The collection also contains a limited amount of lodge correspondence and records from subsidiary Vasa organizations, and constitutions and bylaws. Earlier materials are in Swedish and then gradually switch to English around the mid-20th century, and provide a glimpse into the process of lodge and member assimilation.  Finally, the collection also includes a small amount of material from other Swedish-American organizations, especially Agne Lodge #101 of the Independent Order of Vikings, which shared a meeting house with the Vasa Order of America at 465 Dean Street in Brooklyn.  These non-Vasa materials have been given their own series within the collection."

The minutes for St. Erik are especially rich; they are entirely in Swedish, continuously cover the years 1918 to 1941, and contain numerous clippings and flyers pasted into the minute books, documenting the lodge's many events and activities. The minutes of Harmony #476 cover the period 1935 to 1973, with small gaps throughout and a larger gap from 1939 to 1945.  They are in generally good condition, though a few pages are torn entirely in half. The minutes of the last meeting contain the procedures of the merger with Nobel-Liljan. The minutes of Liljan #107 cover the merger-heavy period 1968 to 1970, and are mostly in Swedish. Some minutes also contain informal lists of benefits paid out to members.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref8_3du\" level=\"series\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eSeries 2: Constitutions and bylaws\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"3314\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e3314\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cphysdesc altrender=\"whole\"\u003e\u003cextent altrender=\"materialtype spaceoccupied\"\u003e0.04 Linear Feet\u003c/extent\u003e\u003cextent altrender=\"carrier\"\u003ein one record carton.\u003c/extent\u003e\u003c/physdesc\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1929/1970\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1929-1970\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_996f15d221a23300f279d0e9543ca9cb\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Contents\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis series contains copies of the constitution of the Vasa Order of America, as well as the bylaws of four lodges: New York District #4, 1940 to 1963; Nobel-Liljan #64, circa 1970; Harmony #476, circa 1957; and St. Erik #338, 1929 to 1970.

First and most numerous are applications for membership in lodges Nobel #64, circa 1949 to 1967; Nordstjernan #89, 1909 to 1963; Liljan #107, 1907 to 1969; Syskonkedjan #306, 1915 to 1968; and Harmony #476, 1934 to 1965.  Many applications are in Swedish. Not all applications are dated, so they have been arranged alphabetically by surname of applicant, with female members who applied while single filed under their maiden names.  Since Nobel was founded in 1904, it is safe to assume that these forms do not represent a complete set for that lodge, and probably not for the other lodges either.  This series also includes membership update forms returned by members of Nobel #64, Nobel- Liljan #64, Liljan #107, Syskonkedjan #306, and Thora #39.  There is also a pad of carbon copy \"membership change reports\" from Nobel #64 only, and several membership lists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref12_pyo\" level=\"series\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eSeries 6: Subsidiary organizations and activities\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"3320\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e3320\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cphysdesc altrender=\"whole\"\u003e\u003cextent altrender=\"materialtype spaceoccupied\"\u003e0.21 Linear Feet\u003c/extent\u003e\u003cextent altrender=\"carrier\"\u003ein one manuscript box.\u003c/extent\u003e\u003c/physdesc\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003ecirca 1933-1980\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_a35abeb7fa6315b8bc2552b3f797664f\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Contents\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis series contains materials from subsidiary organizations and activities of the Vasa Order of America, circa 1933 to 1980.
