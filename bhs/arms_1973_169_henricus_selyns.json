The records document Selyns' day-to-day duties and experiences as a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church in the village of Breuckelen (later Brooklyn), and in many cases read like journal entries or entries in a daily log. The records include lists of marriages, deaths, and church members, and the volume itself includes an alphabetical index of names in the back."
