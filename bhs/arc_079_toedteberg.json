These christening certificates indicate Augustus and Catherine had two or three children prior to Emma and Louise who died in early childhood. A deed to a Green-Wood Cemetery plot addressed to Augustus Toedteberg suggests that these infants were buried together in a Toedteberg family plot. Clippings in the series discuss Augustus and Emma's voyages to Europe, Emma Toedteberg's work at the Long Island Historical Society, and the disposition of her bookplate collection after her death.
