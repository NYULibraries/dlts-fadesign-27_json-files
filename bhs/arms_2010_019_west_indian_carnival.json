He discusses his early impressions of Brooklyn and talks at some length about his continued musical career in New York. He discusses his involvement with the Carnival on Eastern Parkway and his attempts to increase Grenadian participation despite some resistance. Adams describes his impressions of the Brooklyn Carnival as a unique expression of pan-Caribbean unity and African American culture. Adams compares regional differences in Carnival traditions, how the Brooklyn Carnival has changed over time, the economic benefits and some of the challenges facing the celebration.

He contrasts Belizean, New Yorker, and Trinidadian attitudes toward the parade and describes the role of New York and Miami Belizeans in reinvigorating the Carnival tradition in Belize. Adolphus describes his personal connection to the parade and the depth of his commitment with detailed discussions of selecting themes and designing costumes. He describes Belizean culture's mélange of ethnic traditions with an only recently popularized musical tradition and emphasizes the parade's importance in promoting and disseminating Belizean culture and identity. Adolphus discusses fundraising, the challenges involved in organizing a parade contingent, and changes he'd like to see; including the importance of reaching out to the general African American community. He feels that the group doesn't necessarily see themselves reflected in the parade, which is a partial cause of resentment and violence.

Introduced to the West Indian American Day Carnival Association (WIADCA) in 1974, she soon became involved in the organization as its public relations director, a position she still held in 1994 at the time of the interview. She reflects on the experience of Carnival and considers the economic resources the Carnival annually brings to New York City. She notes that the contributions of the Caribbean community have not been fully acknowledged by the government or the media. Alexander suggests that WIADCA should be a year round institution that can serve the community; providing resources for job training and employment and addressing the need of the organization to involve more people from other Caribbean islands. She also discusses the cultural conflicts that have occurred among organizers and finishes with a description of the activities and services provided by the non-profit Caribbean-American Center, of which WIADCA was an affiliate.

She suggests means of improvement. Noting common misconceptions, surrounding Carnival, Byron suggests community education as a possible solution. She ends by noting the possibilities of garnering greater government support and calls for a tighter network among the diasporic Caribbean Carnivals.

Dublin discusses the event of the Carnival in 1994, noting the participation of international bands and media. She relates her frustration that although the Carnival produces revenue for the city, it continues to receive little local media coverage. There is also a discussion of a conflict with the Hasidic Jewish community and their desire to reschedule the Carnival because of the Jewish New Year. Dublin notes the influence technology has had on Carnival. She sees Carnival as an art that brings together different communities to share the beauty of the Caribbean culture.

As a child, he found that Carnival in Trinidad was his opportunity to practice and display his artistic skills. His career has been spent as an architect and carnival designer.

He begins by remembering his own personal origin weaved in with his early participation in Trinidad's Carnival. Evelyn compares his experience with the judging process for that event with the process in Brooklyn's Carnival. He discusses mounting a presentation for Nelson Mandela's visit to the United Nations that couldn't be executed. He recalls his early participation and the stakeholders involved with Brooklyn's early Carnivals. In 1994, Evelyn was in high demand for his designs and consulting work in several North American Carnivals and he relates details about that. He bemoans that Carnival could be turned into a parade of nudity. Evelyn discusses his architectural design for a proposed performance space in Trinidad. His culturally diverse approach to that is contextualized with the diversity of Brooklyn Carnival. He digresses several times in the last half-hour; taking on several weighty issues, revealing some intolerance and theorizing on conspiracies relating to Jewish influence, war, liberty, and the oppression of African Americans and Caribbean Americans.

After that, he departed for a job as a merchant mariner. It was during his travels as a seaman that he first visited the United States and eventually resolved to move to New York City, which he did—alone—in 1954. He lived in Manhattan first before moving to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights. At some point, his wife and children joined him; they were all congregants at Saint Gregory Catholic Church. He continued to work as a mechanic, taking vocational courses to supplement his training, and after a while was able to buy a home on St. John's Place. During this time, he became a prominent figure in the cultural life of Crown Heights' West Indian residents. Along with Rufus (Lionel) Gorin, he was a key organizer of the first Carnival on Labor Day that went down Eastern Parkway, now commonly called the West Indian Day Parade, in 1969. When Gorin died, Lezama was elected the first president of the West Indian American Day Carnival Association (WIADCA)—a position to which he was repeatedly reelected until he retired in 2002.

He compares the Brooklyn Carnival with its analogues throughout the Caribbean and the United States, especially Trinidad. He describes WIADCA's relationship with city government and the police; both in the aftermath of the 1991 Crown Heights unrest and more recently amid an NYPD \"crackdown\" on \"quality of life\" offenses that has affected Carnival participation. He dwells on a dispute with the Hasidim of Crown Heights over the date of the 1994 Carnival, which Lubavitcher Jews claimed would conflict with the holiday of Rosh Hashanah, and how minority-focused newspapers have commented on it.

Seddio was instrumental in the early phases of Brooklyn'sWest Indian American Day Carnival. From 1969-1970, as the community involvement liaison for the New York Police Department, he worked with Carlos Lezama in organizing the logistics of the parade. He later became a consultant for the West Indian American Day Carnival Association (WIADCA). When interviewed in 1994, Seddio was the Chairman of Community Board 18 in Brooklyn and the legal counsel of WIADCA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/bioghist\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_57d2e6500974be43c7bcf55c864173e0\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Contents\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this interview, Frank Seddio reflects on his early experiences and contributions to Brooklyn's Carnival. A former police officer, who worked on the civil logistics, of the Carnival, he describes the initial challenges of running it, including political and police department resistance to recognizing the Carnival as a community festival. He reflects on the necessity to constantly reassess and reformulate the event in its early phases and how it has continued to change during his twenty five years of involvement. He also describes the policies and training the Carnival's context required of New York police officers. The interview ends in a reflection of how his involvement in the Carnival has provided him a unique insight into the Caribbean community. He notes that it is necessary that the larger New York City community recognizes the contribution of the Caribbean community and the Carnival to the fabric of New York.

He sees problems of organization, but acknowledges that because of the size of the event this is inevitable. Simpson recalls his involvement in this Carnival over the years at various levels and it has been because of this collective experience that he became a key player in building the Jamaica Carnival, which takes place in April. He feels that city government can help more and he also thinks that the stature of the Carnival deserves better press, TV coverage, and input from the business sector by way of sponsorship. He argues that big business gets involved with the Macy's Parade and others of that kind, which in his view, cannot compare with the Labor Day Carnival Parade at any level.

Dr. Stanislaus discusses the planning process of the Carnival. In 1994, the Carnival coincided with the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. This created a conflict between Carnival organizers and members of the Hasidic Jewish community of Crown Heights in Brooklyn. Dr. Stanislaus provides his opinion on this situation and that of the Crown Heights riot of 1991.
