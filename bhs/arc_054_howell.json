He worked as a minister in western New York until 1872, when he became the first librarian of the State Library of New York. He later served as the archivist of the State Library. Howell was also a prolific historian of New York State and published local histories of the early colony of New York, the capitol of Albany, the county of Schenectady, and the Long Island towns of Southampton, East Hampton, and Southold. Many of his historical works included detailed family genealogies as well."

The information in the journal pertains to various Southampton families and spans the late 1600s to the mid-1800s. The second item in the collection is a bound, handwritten speech delivered by Howell at the 225th anniversary of the Settlement of Southampton, Long Island, dated 1865. Also included in the back of the volume is an extract from the genealogies of the Howell and Rogers families of Southampton for the years 1625 to 1858."
