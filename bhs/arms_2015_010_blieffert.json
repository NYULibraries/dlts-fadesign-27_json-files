While working in a Milwaukee insurance company during the Great Depression, he met his future wife Helene. They married after the death of both of Charles' parents. Charles and his wife spent their summers at a fisherman’s lake cottage in Wisconsin. He died in May of 1984, at age 92. He Americanized his birth name “Karl” to “Charlie” and pronounced his last name “Bly-furt” rather than “Blee-furt.”"
