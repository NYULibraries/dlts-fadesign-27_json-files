Cabinet photographs, measuring 4.5 x 6.25 inches, consist of a photographic print (generally albumen) that is mounted on a thick card. The cards often include decorative or embossed lettering on the front and reverse of the card that note the photographer or photographic studio that produced the photograph. The popularity of cabinet photographs lasted from the 1860s through the 1890s, though they were continued to be made into the first quarter of the 20th century."
