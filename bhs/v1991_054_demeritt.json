In the course of their excavation, the team uncovered several cisterns and dry wells, as well as many artifacts, including bottles, ceramics, part of a pipe organ, and a pair of men's pants dating from the 19th century. Lymon, along with two of the excavation team members, Martin Schneider and Dwight B. Demeritt Jr., presented their findings at a lecture hosted by the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) on September 20, 1965."
