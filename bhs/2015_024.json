                "value": "Elizabeth Payne (1948-) is a fine artist who grew up in the Midwest United States.  She attended Webster College in St. Louis, Missouri, where she began to concentrate on fine art painting, and received a Masters of Arts degree from Hunter College, New York, New York, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute, San Francisco, California.  A painting of hers was part of the 1975 Biennial Exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art.  Her work while living in Brooklyn and working towards her Master of Arts degree at Hunter College evolved away from minimal abstraction and included portraits of her female artist friends and series relating to Brooklyn.  In 1993, Ms. Payne moved to Yoakum, Texas and her work became more color-field related.  In 2012, she joined the Gentileschi Aegis Gallery Association (\"GAGA\"), a non-profit organization founded by Sylvia Benitez.  Her work has been exhibited in museums and galleries beginning in the early 1970s."
