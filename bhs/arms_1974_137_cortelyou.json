In 1766, he married Altie Rapalje, and they lived for a time on the family farm in the town of New Utrecht that Isaac had inherited from his father. Isaac was fence-viewer of New Utrecht in 1772, an overseer of the poor in 1774, and a deacon at the New Utrecht Dutch Reformed Church. In the late 1780s, Isaac and Altie moved with their three daughters and five sons to a house on present-day Bay 11th Street in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst. A wealthy man, Isaac Cortelyou was the owner of 11 slaves. He willed his farm on Bay 11th Street to his son Johannes Cortelyou (1777-1855), but upon Johannes's suffering a mental breakdown, family relative Timothy Townsend Cortelyou was appointed custodian of the property and sold it to Jacob Bennett in 1831."
