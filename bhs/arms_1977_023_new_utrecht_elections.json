Named after the City of Utrecht in the Netherlands, New Utrecht stretched across the southwestern part of Brooklyn and thrived as a rural farming community. The town later served as the base of operations for the British Army during the first battle of the Revolutionary War, the Battle of Long Island (also known as the Battle of Brooklyn), in June and July of 1776. Because of its fairly isolated location, New Utrecht evaded the widescale industrialization that transformed New York and northern Brooklyn into urban centers in the 18th and 19th centuries, and largely retained its quiet rural character. It was not until 1894, when it was annexed by the City of Brooklyn, that urbanization finally reached New Utrecht, eventually transforming it into a major residential area composed of several distinct neighborhoods. The land that was once New Utrecht now comprises the present-day Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bay Ridge, Fort Hamilton, Dyker Heights, Borough Park, Bensonhurst, and Bath Beach."

The majority of the documents are comprised of poll lists, containing names of voters and tallies indicating the issues and offices each individual voted upon; and election returns, in which the Board of Inspectors of Election reported the results of elections, often including the names of candidates for public office and how many votes each candidate received. Additional items include Inspectors' certificates of appointment and resignations; voters' affidavits and preliminary oaths; Inspectors' canvassing statements, in which the results of elections were tallied and confirmed; and unmarked voting ballots. There are gaps in the collection for the years 1827, 1847 to 1848, 1874 to 1876, 1880 to 1882, and 1884."
