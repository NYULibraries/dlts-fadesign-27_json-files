From highways to hospitals, to large-scale public housing, parks, and bridges, much of today's New York City infrastructure was built under Moses. While Moses served for 26 years as New York City's parks commissioner, park acreage within the City's five-borough park system more than doubled, reaching 34, 673 acres by 1960. Conversely, he was also responsible for leading the construction of major roadways and superhighways in the New York City metropolitan area, many of which cut through entire sections of neighborhoods, often displacing longtime residents. Moses retired from his last position at the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority when the agency was abolished by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1968. He died in 1981 in West Islip, N.Y. at the age of 92."
