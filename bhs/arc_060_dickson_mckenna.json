The collection consists of news clippings, magazine articles, publications, brochures, flyers, newsletters, photographs, and ephemera, the majority concerning the brownstone movement and the development and renewal of Brooklyn neighborhoods. The material covers a wide range of topics from architecture to home remodeling and gives an overview of the efforts of McKenna and the Brooklyn community in the 1970s and 1980s to preserve and revitalize their neighborhoods. It also holds a small but significant collection of McKenna's general business documents and personal papers, including records and correspondence relating to his book."
