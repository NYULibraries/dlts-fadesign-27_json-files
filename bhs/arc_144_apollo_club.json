Despite being a male-only choir, female soloists regularly performed with the Apollo Club and many women joined as subscribing members. The club hosted annual seasons of concerts held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The club experienced financial difficulties during the 1960s, and its final concert was held in 1966. In total, the Apollo Club of Brooklyn performed 258 concerts over 88 seasons."
