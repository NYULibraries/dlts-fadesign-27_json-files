The items appear to chiefly document Foote's leisure and social interests during the period and include event programs, invitations, and admission tickets for events such as the circus, theater, exhibitions, sporting contests (such as football and yachting), horse shows, and dances.  Institutions and organizations represented in such material include: Ringling Bros and Barnum \u0026amp; Bailey Circus, the Brooklyn Junior Horse Show, the Brooklyn Horse Show, Columbia University/Navy, Colony House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Brooklyn Music Settlement, Junior League of Brooklyn, Bellport Country Club, Bellport Bay Yacht Club, and American Yacht Club (Rye, New York).  Other items are related to Foote's school years and include items such as programs, class schedules, and handwritten sorority rush invitations.  A few additional news clippings and other ephemeral items were inserted loose at the front of the album, including a portion of the cover of the December 18, 1938 issue of the \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eBrooklyn Eagle\u003c/emph\u003e featuring a photograph of Foote as a debutante.  These loose materials can be found in folders 10 to 18 of the collection."
