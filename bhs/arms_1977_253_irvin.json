He later became the first art editor of \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eThe New Yorker\u003c/emph\u003e. Between the years 1925 and 1958, hundreds of Irvin's illustrations and cartoons were published in \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eThe New Yorker\u003c/emph\u003e, and his art adorned the covers of 169 issues of the magazine. Irvin also created the iconic character of Eustace Tilley, a fashionable gentleman with a monocle and top hat who, from 1925 to 2000, appeared on the cover of \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eThe New Yorker\u003c/emph\u003e every year except 1994.
