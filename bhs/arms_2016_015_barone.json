The series is almost exclusively black-and-white photographic prints, but also includes several color photographic prints and a small number of photographic negatives. The photographs mostly consist of snapshots of members of the Barone family and friends in largely unidentified locations and show children and adults primarily outdoors and at leisure. The early childhood of siblings Alfred D. Barone, Victoria Barone, and Myron Barone is particularly well represented. Approximately 20 of the photographs are studio portraits, the subjects of which include Melchisedech Alfred Barone, Alfred D. Barone, and Victoria Barone, among others. The series also contains several class photographs, including a wide format photograph of a class at Erasmus Hall High School (1931). Photographs of Alfred D. Barone and Melvin Barone in military uniform and an outdoor group portrait of the 2nd Platoon CO \"H\" 1st Signal Training Regiment taken at Camp Edison in New Jersey in 1943 are also present. Some of the photographs are dated and identified on the verso and locations include the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, California, Wyoming, and Washington, D.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/scopecontent\u003e\n            \u003c/c\u003e\n        "
