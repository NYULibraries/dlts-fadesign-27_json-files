The viewbook contains only a few scenes of Brooklyn, though images of the Brooklyn Bridge and the entrances to the Brooklyn Bridge are well-represented in the viewbook. The viewbook has its original hardcover and its pages measure 6.75 x 7.5. The binding is broken and all of the pages are now loose. Digital versions of the images from the viewbook pertaining to Brooklyn are available via the image database located in the library. It is not known who created or printed the viewbook."
