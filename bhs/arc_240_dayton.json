Dayton's regarding the cost and sale of cotton, as well as the affairs of the town of Speonk in Long Island, such as property matters and the history of the naming of the town. References to African Americans are also included in the notes. The label on one of J.R.'s emptied envelopes indicates that it had contained the notes of Orrin Dayton, so it is possible that Orrin's notes are also included here. Materials date from 1867 to 1902."
