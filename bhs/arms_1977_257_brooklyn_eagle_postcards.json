Founded in 1841 by Isaac van Anden and Henry Cruse Murphy, the newspaper was originally named the \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eBrooklyn Eagle and King's County Democrat\u003c/emph\u003e. In 1850, the name was changed to the \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eBrooklyn Daily Eagle\u003c/emph\u003e. By the early 1860s, the newspaper had become one of the most widely read papers in the United States. In 1938, the newspaper underwent another name change when it became the \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eBrooklyn Eagle\u003c/emph\u003e. Frank D. Schroth bought the paper in 1940 and continued to publish it until 1955 when the \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eEagle \u003c/emph\u003eceased publication during a lengthy strike by the New York Newspaper Guild. Between 1960 and 1963, the \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eEagle \u003c/emph\u003eonce again resumed publication, this time as a weekly paper (though for a short time as a daily). The run was short-lived and the \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eBrooklyn Eagle\u003c/emph\u003e office closed in December 1963. In 1996, J. Dozier Hasty, the owner and publisher of Brooklyn Heights Press, purchased the Eagle's name and logo and began to publish the \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eBrooklyn Daily Eagle \u0026amp; Daily Bulletin\u003c/emph\u003e. As of 2011, the \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eBrooklyn Daily Eagle \u0026amp; Daily Bulletin\u003c/emph\u003e remains a daily newspaper, published five days per week."
