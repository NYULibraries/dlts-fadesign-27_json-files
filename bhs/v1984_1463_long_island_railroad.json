During the 19th and early 20th centuries, LIRR expanded while absorbing and merging with dozens of railroads in Kings, Queens, Suffolk, and Nassau counties. In response to public outcry over pollution produced by steam engines, LIRR began electrification of its system in 1905. In preparation, grade separation projects on what is now the LIRR's Atlantic Branch replaced street-level tracks in Brooklyn with elevated and underground lines. As of 2011, LIRR remains one of the oldest railroads in the country, and the busiest commuter rail system in the United States."

Photographs in the collection document the construction of grade-separated LIRR tracks from Brooklyn into Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. Items in the collection are arranged geographically, starting at the Atlantic Avenue terminal in Downtown Brooklyn, moving through Queens and along the North Shore of Long Island as far east as Rocky Point, N.Y. Photographs are taken at track level and depict cleared land, underground infrastructure such as pipes and tunnels, laying of railroad ties, completed tracks, stations, crossing towers, and laborers at work during the various stages of construction. Most images are identified by date, location (including street and city in urban areas, or nearby city and property owner in suburban areas), cardinal direction of view, and the photographer's initials."
