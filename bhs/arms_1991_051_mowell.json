The second half of the final account book relates to Mowell's work as an automobile chauffeur and records details of his daily activities, including the mileage of each journey, the daily weather, road conditions, and places visited. Several news clippings containing nautical items of interest to Mowell, as well as photographs of Mowell's tugboats and other ships in New York Harbor and around the world, are interfiled throughout the account books.
