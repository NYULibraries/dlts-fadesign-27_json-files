Outside of his position as a tobacco merchant, Messenger would gain further recognition as the President of the Brooklyn Bank, a position he held for 25 years and in which he continued to serve up until his death on October 20, 1881. At the time of his death, Messenger retained positions as Senior Director of the Home Insurance Company of New York, Treasurer of the Brooklyn City Hospital, and Trustee of the Brooklyn Eye and Ear Infirmary and the Industrial School. Upon the death of Thomas and Ann Messenger, a memorial window was erected at the All Saints' Church in Great Neck. The Messengers were well-known for their generous donations to both All Saints' Church and St. Ann's Church in Brooklyn. Ann Messenger, whose exact date of death is unknown, survived her husband by no more than 15 years. The eldest Messenger daughter, Emma Gignoux-Messenger, died in 1915, survived by her sister, Marie, whose date of death is unknown."
