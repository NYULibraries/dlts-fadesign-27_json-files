In 1933, the Society's name was legally changed to the Medical Society of the County of Kings and Academy of Medicine of Brooklyn to reflect its dual professional and educational roles, and it remained a vital resource for Brooklyn physicians throughout the rest of the 20th century. As of 2010, the Society continues to function as a regulating organization for Brooklyn medical professionals, examining and defending the credentials of its member physicans and encouraging the dissemination of accurate medical knowledge. The Society is now based in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bay Ridge."
