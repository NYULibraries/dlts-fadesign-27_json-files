SOS, along with the National Organization for Women (NOW) and Women's Health Action Mobilization (WHAM!), organized a boycott of Domino's Pizza. Domino's CEO Tom Monaghan was a major contributor to right-to-life-organizations and resigned as a result of the boycott. SOS also held the yearly National Student Conference on Reproductive Rights, a field organizer program, and a training task force on reproductive rights. SOS reorganized in 1992 and broadened its agenda to include AIDS/HIV awareness, date rape, and full access to affordable healthcare. The organization was active until 1995, when its records came to the Tamiment Library."
