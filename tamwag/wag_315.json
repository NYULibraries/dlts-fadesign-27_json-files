Materials include bargaining files, newsletters, flyers, correspondence, mailings and publications of the international union, scripts of radio spots, clippings, photocopies of scholarly articles, typescript histories and Holden's notes on labor history.  One folder contains a number of photographs of UE demonstrations in Connecticut in the 1940s.  Holden also collected flyers distributed by rival electrical workers' unions, reflecting the bitter political attacks on the union, which was often accused of being Communist-led."
