As an attorney Popper defended several prominent figures accused of Communist affiliations, including Dalton Trumbo and John Howard Lawson of the ''Hollywood Ten.\" In later years he represented the family of slain Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) civil rights worker Andrew Goodman, participated in nuclear disarmament campaigns, founded the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and offered support for the Palestinian Liberation Organization on behalf of the New York City Chapter of the NLG."
