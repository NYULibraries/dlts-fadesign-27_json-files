Some of the material is authored by Oursler. One notable document is a 16 pp. typescript on the relations between the SDA (Social Democracy of America -- possibly referring to or a shortening of the Socialist Party-Social Democratic Federation) and the Young Socialist League, probably written in the mid to late 1950s.
