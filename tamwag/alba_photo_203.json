There are also a few shots of naval\n        vessels on the coast of North Africa and a few images of snowy mountains. The many shots of\n        Nationalist troops, Spanish officials, and individuals in German uniform suggest that the\n        photographs might have been taken by a German visitor, touring Spain toward the end of, or\n        just after, the Civil War. The slides were the property of Eric Muller, a professional\n        photographer from Lynn, MA, who got them from a returning U.S. serviceman who had served in\n        Europe in World War II."
