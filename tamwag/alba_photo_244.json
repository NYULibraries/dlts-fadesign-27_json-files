Photographs are\n        black and white prints ranging from 2 1/4\" square to 5\" x 7\". The scrapbook contains 23\n        pages, with photographs on both sides (= 64 pages of photographs); the rest of the pages are\n        blank. Many of the photos are labeled and typed commentary on battles at Ebro, on the Aragon\n        front and Teruel is also included within the scrapbook."
