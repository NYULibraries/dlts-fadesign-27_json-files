He was especially interested in Chile and Allende. His research on this topic led him into undertaking the writing of a history from a Marxist perspective (this manuscript is not among the papers). In his personal life, Schwartz was a witty, multi-faceted man who along with other activities, wrote lyrics under the name Ted Persons and produced a TV show in the early 1950s, the AdLibbers."
