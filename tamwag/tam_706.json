Siding with the Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN) rather than the Contras, the right-wing militant groups funded by the United States government since the Reagan administration, the organization formed a close relationship with Dan Juan del Rio Coco, a municipality in northern Nicaragua. Not only did the Brooklyn Sister City Project designate Dan Juan del Rio Coco as their \"sister city,\" but the organization also sought to achieve their goals of peace and education through letter writing (to both community members and government officials), by sending local groups to their sister site, and by sponsoring visits of Nicaraguans in Brooklyn. The group also produced a newsletter and hosted a series of fundraising events, lectures, and exhibitions, including a memorial for Benjamin Linder, an American engineer who was killed by the Contras near the village of  San José de Bocay in 1987."
