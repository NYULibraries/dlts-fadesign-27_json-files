For the over 70 men currently on hunger strike in Guantanamo, it has been seven years too long. We want justice now. Witness Against Torture announces a campaign to close the U.S. detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and end torture and rendition by the U.S. within the first 100 days of the new administration.

The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 mobilized our country in the fight against terrorism. However, this also launched a serious civil liberties crises.

The CPUSA played a pivotal role in many significant political and social movements of the 20th century. Its Party platform focused largely on working class issues such as fair wages and unemployment, civil rights for racial and ethnic minorities, civil liberties for politically persecuted communities, economic justice for the poor, the unemployed and for immigrants, and international peace efforts. The Party's work left an indelible mark in the arena of progressive politics and made it an influential force in the labor movement, particularly from the 1920s to the 1940s. Its varied political, social, and cultural initiatives attracted the support of a number of prominent artists, intellectuals, and activists, including Woody Guthrie, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Angela Davis. Though the CPUSA's strength and size declined sharply following World War II and the advent of the Cold War and McCarthyism, it remains committed to socialism, peace, economic and social justice, and civil rights and liberties. Today, the CPUSA continues its struggle for socialism, peace, and social and economic justice, and publishes a newspaper, the People's Weekly World (http://webarchives.cdlib.org/site/sw11834j9g), a monthly journal, Political Affairs (http://webarchives.cdlib.org/site/sw1r49hs90), and through its Labor Commission, the online periodical Labor Upfront (captured here: http://webarchives.cdlib.org/site/spec:0000000z7).

The Five were allegedly in the United States to observe and infiltrate the Cuban-American groups Alpha 66, the F4 Commandos, the Cuban American National Foundation, and Brothers to the Rescue. The Five appealed their convictions and the alleged lack of fairness in their trial. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned their convictions in 2005, citing the \"prejudices\" of Miami's anti-Castro Cubans, but the full court later reversed the five's bid for a new trial and reinstated the original convictions. In June 2009 the US Supreme Court declined to review the case. In Cuba, the Five are viewed as national heroes and portrayed as having sacrificed their liberty in the defense of their country.

Sobell was also convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage and was sentenced to 30 years in jail. Approximately ten years later, the National Committee to Reopen the Rosenberg Case (NCRRC) was formed and has continuously been in existence ever since. Aaron Katz, a member of the original committee, served as director for 42 years, until his retirement in 2005. The current co-directors are Leonard Lehrman and Richard Corey. The Committee seeks to have the Rosenbergs and Sobell exonerated and to have the government publicly address and own up to its complicity in the terrible miscarriage of justice that took place in this case. The NCRRC also supports campaigns to redress the unjust incarceration and excessive punishment of prisoners; including the imposition of the death penalty on Mumia Abu-Jamal. The NCRRC deplores the dismal failure of our judicial system and calls for its review and reform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eRosenberg, Ethel, 1915-1953 |x Trials, litigation, etc. \u003c/subject\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eRosenberg, Julius, 1918-1953 |x Trials, litigation, etc. \u003c/subject\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eJewish communists -- United States.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref1029\" level=\"otherlevel\" otherlevel=\"website\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eNational Housing Law Project Archived Website\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eMar 5, 2012 - ongoing\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onLoad\" ns2:href=\"https://wayback.archive-it.org/6347/*/http://nhlp.org/\" ns2:role=\"translation missing: en.enumerations.file_version_use_statement.service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"National Housing Law Project\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eNational Housing Law Project\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_6f8379daf85827d408f94b1b5ba2eb3f\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Contents note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe National Housing Law Project is a nonprofit national housing and legal advocacy center established in 1968.

Many of these documents are available in multiple locations on the Internet and in numerous private collections, thanks to landmark Freedom of Information Act and habeas litigation, leaks from whistleblowers, public relations releases from government, investigative reporting by journalists including the Torturing Democracy team, and Congressional investigations. But the disparate locations, enormous volume of documents, and lack of indexing or standard cataloging have presented real difficulties for users. With support from the Open Society Institute and the JEHT Foundation since 2006, the National Security Archive has undertaken to bring together all these materials in digital formats, organize and catalog them for maximum utility and access, and publish them online in multiple packages including a comprehensive searchable database. By combining released executive branch policy memoranda, legal documents from U.S. and foreign courts, and on-the-ground information about actual practices by the U.S. military and intelligence personnel, the Torture Archive presents a comprehensive view of the war on terrorism, its foundations and its implications. This initial launch of the Torture Archive includes the complete set of declassified Combatant Status Review Tribunal and Administrative Review Board files from the Pentagon, and thousands of documents resulting from FOIA litigation brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Archive and other plaintiffs. The Torture Archive will continue to add documents as they are released through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation or Executive discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eIraq War, 2003-2011 -- Moral and ethical aspects -- United States.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eTorture |z United States.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref2314\" level=\"otherlevel\" otherlevel=\"website\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eNational Organization for Women, NYC Archived Website\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003corigination label=\"Creator\"\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eNational Organization for Women.

Organized as the Workingmen's Party in 1876, the Party was renamed in 1877.Its longtime leader was Daniel De Leon (1852-1914), Marxist author and editor of The People, the SLP newspaper. As the only nationally organized party of socialism in America until 1900, the SLP attracted Socialists of all tendencies to its ranks. However, the Marxist element became dominant by 1890, when the Party was reorganized on a Marxist basis. The SLP has played a prominent role in the economic and political life of the United States. It ran the first socialist presidential campaign in 1892, and fielded national tickets in every presidential campaign through 1976. The SLP's goal is a classless society based on collective ownership and control of the industries and social services, these to be administered in the interests of all society through a Socialist Industrial Union government composed of democratically elected representatives from all the industries and services of the land. Production would be carried on for use instead of profit. The SLP program for achieving this revolutionary change from capitalism to socialism is based on the Marxist tenet that socialism can be achieved only through the classconscious action \"of the working class itself.\" The Socialist Industrial Union program, as the SLP program is known, developed by Daniel De Leon (1852-1914), is a continuation of Karl Marx's ideas on a workers' government. In all essentials--political and economic classwide organization, the breakup of the state, workers' democracy, the seizure of social power by the organized producers and their socialist reorganization of the economy--the SIU program of the SLP conforms to the democratic premises underlying Marx's concept of socialism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eSocialism -- United States.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref1747\" level=\"otherlevel\" otherlevel=\"website\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eSocialist Party of New York City Archived Website\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003corigination label=\"Creator\"\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eSocialist Party of New York\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003c/origination\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"2009/2014\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003eAug 10, 2009-Aug 14, 2014\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onLoad\" ns2:href=\"https://wayback.archive-it.org/6338/*/http://spnyc.org/home/\" ns2:role=\"translation missing: en.enumerations.file_version_use_statement.service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Socialist Party of New York City\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eSocialist Party of New York City: Aug 10, 2009-Aug 14, 2014\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_a6a3d5697823084392310ac2e8f7586a\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Contents note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe website of the NYC Local of the Socialist Party USA.

Wagner Labor Archives at New York University form a unique, internationally-known center for scholarly research on Labor and the Left. The primary focus is the complex relationship between trade unionism and progressive politics and how this evolved over time. Archival, print, photograph, film, and oral history collections describe the history of the labor movement and how it related to the broader struggle for economic, social, and political change. In 1977 the Robert F. Wagner Archives was established as a joint program of the New York City Central Labor Council and the Tamiment Library. The Wagner is the designated repository for the records of the Council's more than 200 member unions. Today the Library has an extraordinary research collection documenting the history of organized labor in New York and the workers who built the City. Tamiment has one of the finest research collections in the country documenting the history of radical politics: socialism, communism, anarchism, utopian experiments, the cultural left, the New Left, and the struggle for civil rights and civil liberties. It is the repository for the Archives of Irish America, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, and a growing Asian American labor collection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref1868\" level=\"otherlevel\" otherlevel=\"website\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eTeachers for a Just Contract Archived Website\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"2011/2012\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003eMay 4, 2011-Aug 2, 2012\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onLoad\" ns2:href=\"https://wayback.archive-it.org/6340/*/http://teachersforajustcontract.org/\" ns2:role=\"translation missing: en.enumerations.file_version_use_statement.service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Teachers for a Just Contract\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeachers for a Just Contract\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_036f9c794c99ba9865b7a42e960821f9\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Contents note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeachers for a Just Contract is a New York City base organization that works to improve the working conditions of teachers by struggling for the vigorous enforcement of their collective bargaining agreement, particularly in relation to disciplinary actions, harassment and job security.
