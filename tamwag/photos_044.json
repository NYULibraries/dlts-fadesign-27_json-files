His first widely published pictures depicted returning prisoners of war in Austria and brought him to the attention of \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eLife\u003c/emph\u003e  magazine, which published his photo essay \"Homecoming.\" At the invitation of Robert Capa, Haas joined the cooperative Magnum Photos in 1949, developing close associations with Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Werner Bishof. In 1951 Haas moved to New York and continued to take black and white assignments for magazines while experimenting with color film. His color photo essay of New York City was published in \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eLife\u003c/emph\u003e in 1953 and was a turning point in the acceptance of color photography as an art form and abstraction as a photographic style. Haas became president of Magnum in 1959. Throughout his career, he worked in photojournalism, advertising, and as a still photographer for films, bridging the gap between photojournalism and the use of photography as a medium for artistic expression. He wrote four books during his lifetime, including \"The Creation\" (1971).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/bioghist\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_027df5caf9a61297e61f07d130f5858f\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Content Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe series contains 32 black and white prints made by photographer Ernst Haas, possibly between 1948 and 1952, for the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), the administrative arm of the Marshall Plan.
