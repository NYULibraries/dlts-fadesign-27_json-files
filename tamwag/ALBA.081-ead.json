This collection consists chiefly of typescripts of his writings, as well as some correspondence from the 1980s and 1990s and printed materials. Newman wrote hundreds of short works, in a variety of genres (short stories, plays, parodies, lyrics, poetry, etc.), most are of a humorous, political and satirical, nature, which is reflected in their whimsical titles. Most appear to date from the 1970s and 1980s."
