He was a leading advocate of nuclear disarmament, and a longtime co-chairman of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. His later books, including \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eAfter Capitalism: From Managerialism to Workplace Economy\u003c/emph\u003e (2001), describe the potential of employee self-management, an idea that interested him for decades. As a young man, he briefly lived on a kibbutz in Israel, and later in his career participated in studies and meetings on the productivity of such collective settlements."
