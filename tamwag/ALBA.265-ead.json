He joined the Socialist Party as a teenager, and later became active in the Workers Alliance, a labor organization for WPA workers and in other labor struggles. In 1936, when he was twenty-five years old, he narrowly escaped lynching in Rockwood TN, where he was supporting a strike of mill workers. He volunteered for service with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. On his return from Spain he spoke in defense of the Spanish Republican cause and continued his Socialist Party activity, running for governor of Virginia on the Socialist ticket in 1941."
