UE Locals 1207 and 1217 soon merged with it. During its height (the World War II period) the local claimed 7,000 members. In 1956, when UE District 4 joined the International Union of Electrical Workers (IEU), Local 1227 received a new charter as Local 477 IUE. In 1959 it merged with Local 431. Contents include a charter dated 1937, a UE GEB decision relating to membership and rights and privileges, and executive board minutes of Local 1227 from 1941. Note: The collection also includes a minute book containing minutes of the Executive Board of the Amalgamated Machine and Instrument Local 475 (UE, Brooklyn, NY), Feb 1940-Feb 1941."
