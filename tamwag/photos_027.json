Another image shows UAW President Homer Martin speaking during the organizing campaign at the Tarrytown, New York Chevrolet Plant (1937). A group portrait at the UAW South Bend Convention (nd) shows Frank Tussi, George Addes and Homer Martin of the UAW with CIO leaders John Lewis, David Dubinsky and John Brophy. Six snapshots provide an informal view of life at Brookwood Labor College. Copyright to all but one of the copy prints belongs to photographer Lucienne Bloch; these require permission to be reproduced. There are also another half-dozen photographs, with no captions or identifying information, that appear to have been shot during the latter part of Jonas' life (they may include images of him as an elderly man)."
