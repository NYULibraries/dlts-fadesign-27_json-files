Rivers was active in the civil rights movement and the Greek anti-fascist movement. The collection contains photocopies of three scrapbooks (which contain photographs, correspondence and clippings) as well as correspondence from various leaders of UE, notably James Matles, and figures such as Cesar Chavez, Congressman William F. Ryan, Rockwell Kent, Michael Quill, Pete Seeger, and Elliott Roosevelt. While the majority of the material pertains to Rivers' labor activism, there is material on a broad range of political topics and causes, including a file of printed ephemera relating to the struggle against fascism in Greece.
