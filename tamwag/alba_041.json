He graduated from high school and worked at various odd jobs, while becoming deeply involved in radical politics. He soon joined the Young Communist League.  When he volunteered for service with the International Brigades in Spain he reportedly dissuaded one of his brothers from doing the same, arguing that it was necessary to stay at home and work to help support the family.  Irving sailed from New York, according to his sister Betty's account, on February 23, 1938 and was killed in an ambush at Gandesa in July 1938. The collection consists of eight letters written from Spain by Fishgold to \"folks\" (presumably to both his parents, although they were long separated) and his sister Betty. "
