She returned in 1972 following her mother's death, but not in an official capacity. The motivation behind her return was to finish a writing project about the changes and theatre history in Greenwich Village. She found, however, that the notes and original materials to be used (both hers and projects of students) were missing. It seems from the incomplete selection of articles, plays, and stories in this collection, that the material was either never recovered, or partially recovered. Helen Murphy spent the last years of her life in Rockport, a small seaside town in northern Massachusetts. She died on March 26, 1986, a few months before her 97th birthday. The full-fledged theatre program at Greenwich House was not continued in her absence, and today, only a token class or two each season acts as a tribute to the earlier glory days of the program as it was under Miss Murphy."
