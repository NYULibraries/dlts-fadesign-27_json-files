Materials in this collection document the early lives of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the espionage trial of engineer Morton Sobell, and the public campaign asserting Sobell's innocence. Multiple photographs feature North Dakota Senator William Langer, figures active in Sobell's defense, and Morton's wife, Helen Sobell. The collection also contains a photograph given to New York politician Miriam Friedlander inscribed by activist, lawyer, and Congresswoman Bella Abzug. "
