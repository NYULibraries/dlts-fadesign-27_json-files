Refugees from fascism, both received U.S. visas in 1941 with the aid of Lovestone. Elly received a Ph.D. in sociology in 1927 in her native Germany, while Leo, born in Poland, studied economics and history in Berlin. Both worked as researchers and educators, frequently on behalf of the labor movement, in Europe and the U.S. before settling at the AFL around the end of World War II. The unprocessed papers contain office and personal correspondence, reports, memos to the Executive council of the AFL CIO, newspaper clippings, translations of correspondence and foreign press articles, printed materials, and Elly and Leo Borochowicz's manuscripts and research notes. Most of the collection is in English. There is, however, a considerable amount of material in German, much less in French, and some of Leo Borochowicz's research notes are in Russian.\n"

Relations between the Allied nations   particularly between the United States and Russia   were anything but smooth as World War II (WWII) drew to a close, and a corresponding antagonism evolved between the American and Soviet trade union movements. It was the conviction of David Dubinsky, who had been vice president of the AFL in 1945, William Green, who was active in international affairs for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and George Meany, who was, in 1944, the Secretary Treasurer of the AFL, that the Soviets tried to infiltrate Western Europe through trade unions. To counter any Communist threat, these three men helped found the FTUC in 1944. They appointed Jay Lovestone as the FTUC's Executive Secretary.\nThe history, organizational structure, and pursuits of the FTUC and later the International Affairs Department of the AFL CIO remain elusive. There are no organizational charts and there is no clear statement of the concrete activities of this arm of the AFL CIO. The FTUC was under the direction of the AFL. The people who worked for the FTUC were accountable to the Executive Council of the AFL. In 1955, with the merger of the AFL CIO, the FTUC was suspended. Its work, however, continued and flourished in the International Affairs Department of the AFL CIO with Jay Lovestone as the Director of that department. The tasks of the FTUC and later the International Affairs Department were to monitor labor developments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, develop contacts with union leaders throughout the world, take a leading role in the work of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), counter propaganda of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), monitor foreign press coverage of labor issues, and educate and inform foreign workers about working conditions in the United States and the trade unions in the United States."

These too she separated from her other personal correspondence, and this separation was respected in the present arrangement. Aside from being in a folder separate from her other personal correspondence, there was no discernible order within these letters. Since Elly Borochowicz s friends and acquaintances sent these letters in a very brief space of time, they have been arranged alphabetically by the senders last name as opposed to chronologically. This section gives us an idea of Elly and Leo Borochowicz's circle of friends and tells us something of Leo Borochowicz's personality."
