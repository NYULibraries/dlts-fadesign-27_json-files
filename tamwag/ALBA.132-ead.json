The collection includes correspondence, most of it with Victor Berch, Archivist of the ALBA collections at Brandeis, published and unpublished articles, bibliographies and bibliography cards, copies of documents, lists, and translations (most by Sarbaugh, some by others). Items by Sarbaugh include: \"Spanish Civil War Aviators in Literature and Popular Fiction\" and \"Hidden History: Catalan Women Pilots for the Spanish Republic\" (1987)."
