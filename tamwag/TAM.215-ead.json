This unprocessed collection consists of correspondence and typescripts (principally of Sam Brandon), documents, ephemera, clippings, and some proceedings of various De Leonite organizations. Notable are the files from the 1920s and 1930s which closely document his expulsion from and ongoing disagreements with the SLP, and the founding of the IUL and IUP. The bulk of the collection covers the years 1970-1984, and documents Brandonâ€™s leading activities in several short-lived De Leonite political groupings.
