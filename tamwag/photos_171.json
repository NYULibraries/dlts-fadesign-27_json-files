The United Front was founded and led by Reverend Charles Koen. On March 31, 1969, white vigilante groups (\"White Hats\"), in cooperation with the local police, shot into an all-black housing project for two and a half hours. Although it was not the first attack on the black population in Cairo, it led the impetus to begin an economic boycott against white owned businesses in downtown Cairo. The boycott lasted throughout the 1970s and contributed to the economic hardships that would face the city later, closing many businesses in Cairo. In addition, the organization sponsored rallies, building funds for a new shopping center, and provided support to the black community due to increased economic hardship because of the boycott and from lack of food."

Most of the photographs were taken by Carl Hampton, who was a United Front public information officer. The photographs mostly relate to the struggle between segments of the African-American community and the predominantly white reactionary city government in Cairo, Illinois. Many images are of black protestors picketing or at rallies, including Ralph Abernathy, Nina Simone, and Charles Koen, who was the national organizer of the United Front and civil rights activist. The protestors are predominantly picketing stores in effect against white racist merchants in Downtown Cairo. There are also photographs of white supremacists, police and vigilante raids, and city government officials. Photographs are accompanied by detailed captions, which are stapled onto the images."
