The letters relate the daily life of McHenry, Malone, their spouses, and their children.  Other letters were written by Edward Malone, Thomas Canning, James Hayden, James Pendergast, Kate Malone, Martin McHenry, Ellen Farrel, Thomas Nixon, and Stephen Gaule.  Most of the letters were written from Middle Granville, but there are some from Boston, Massachusetts; Inistioge and Carrick, Ireland; Addington, New Zealand; Chicago, Illinois; Iron Mountain, Missouri; and Wappingers Falls, New York.  Lynch-Brennan's research includes facsimiles of photographs of members of the Malone and McHenry families and a history of Mt. Carmel Church in Middle Granville; genealogical research on the Malone and McHenry families; and correspondence with Lucille Noel regarding the Malone and McHenry families."
