Caylor's other writings dealt with labor, socialism and racial justice. In his autobiography, \u003ctitle render=\"italic\"\u003eIf My Memory Serves Me Right\u003c/title\u003e, he writes of his early years in Philadelphia, the socialist movement, the single-tax community of Arden, Delaware and the Rand School, as well as of such individuals as Hillquit, Frances Perkins, Rose Schneiderman, Pauline Newman and others. Caylor also wrote a series of letters to the Orlando Sentinel on political and social issues which he then used as the basis of a seminar at Rollins College, in Florida, in 1958."

Most of the images are traditional family album portraits and informal snapshots (including views of family and friends at Arden and several portraits and snapshots of Joseph Cohen). In addition, there are also a number of shots of meetings of organizations. Included are an International Labour Organization meeting in Geneva, Switzerland,in 1938; Social Security Board Federal Advisory Council for Employment Security meeting, 1942; Seminar Workmen's Compensation, Toronto 1946, and Testimonial Dinner, International Typographical Union, Local 2, 1941. Group portraits provide important documentation for the Socialist Party of Pennsylvania - the Socialist State Convention, Reading, Pa, 1930; the Socialist Convention, Harrisburg, 1909; the Pennsylvania delegation to the national Socialist Convention, 1912, and the Philadelphia delegation to the state convention, in Harrisburg, 1932. In addition there is a snapshot of Joe Cohen with the Pennsylvania socialist, James Maurer. Of particular interest is a snapshot of Aaron Berkman of Philadelphia, Charlie Chaplin, and Upton Sinclair (date unknown, although it appears to be pre-1920s, place unknown also)."
