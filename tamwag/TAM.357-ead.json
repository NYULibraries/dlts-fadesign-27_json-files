(JASSI) was formed in 1981 by Midori Shimanouchi Lederer to address the lack of social services for aging Japanese Americans with limited English language skills and little access to information about social service programs. Currently the only professional social services agency for the Japanese community on the East Coast, it provides information or referral services to a wide range of Japanese Americans, including restaurant workers, students, recent immigrants, and and others in the New York area. This unprocessed collection contains administrative materials, including minutes, correspondence, grant applications and employee files as well as financial information such as budgets, audits and payroll information. Also included are materials on services, workshops and events sponsored by JASSI, including client files, intake sheets and volunteer work records. Publicity materials, including brochures, newsletters and press releases are also present. The collection also includes photographs and scrapbooks documenting JASSI events and services. \n                \u003cemph render=\"bold\"\u003eNOTE:\u003c/emph\u003e In order to protect the privacy of individual clients and/or employees, researchers who are granted access to case files must, before viewing these files, sign the Library's Case Files Policy Form, by which they agree that in their writings and public presentations they will not refer to individuals by name, or describe them in any way that will compromise their privacy or that of their families.
