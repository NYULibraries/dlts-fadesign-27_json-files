He is a member of the Arizona Education Association and a co-founder of Arizona Educators United. The Noah Karvelis Papers on Arizona Teachers Organizing consists of six PDF files from March and April 2018 documenting Karvelis' involvement in labor organizing by rank-and-file educators in Arizona. Materials include a flyer, press releas, speech notes and transcript, a campaign action timeline, and an agenda for a town hall documenting the organizing efforts of Arizona Educators United (AEU) concerning teachers' wages, classroom conditions, lack of teaching materials, and the larger state of education in Arizona. Many of the documents in this collection focus on the #RedForEd Facebook event."
