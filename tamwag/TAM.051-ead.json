Established largely by veterans of the New Left, NAM wanted to move beyond the activism of the 1960s and rejected a Communist \"vanguard party\" approach to organizing. The group was opposed to the Vietnam War and called for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. NAM's overarching goal was to create a democratic socialist society, characterized by racial, sexual and economic equality. In 1982, the organization joined with the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, led by Michael Harrington, to form the Democratic Socialists of America."
