The album, possibly constructed from two or three smaller\n        albums, was presented by Hans Grolheim to U.S. volunteer Edward Lending in 1986 on the\n        occasion of the 50th anniversary of the War. Contents are 2 sets of black and white photos,\n        mounted on cards; one set of 24 images is numbered and accompanied by two copies of a\n        booklet with detailed captions. Three small color prints may be of the original covers of\n        the albums. The other is a similar-sized set of unnumbered photos, with similar scenes of\n        groups of volunteers at the front and some images showing Austrian and other veterans\n        retreating from Spain, in camps in France, and in later years. Also included is are\n        photocopies of some of the original photo album pages and a photocopy of statements on the\n        War and the role of Austrian volunteers by General Julius Deutsch and Major Anton\n        Dobritzhofer, with a signed presentation note to Edward Lending from Hans Grolheim."
