Patrinos also served on the Party's National Committee. In 1991, the year of the fall of the Soviet Union, she joined the Committees of Correspondence, founded by dissident (democratic-socialist oriented) CPUSA members inspired by the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, and several U.S. leftists. In 1994 the organization changed its name to the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism, and Patrinos served on its National Coordinating Committee."
