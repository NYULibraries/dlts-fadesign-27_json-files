The project sought to reexamine immigrants' and migrants' patterns of cultural adaptation to urban and industrial life in the early 20th century in order to challenge the prevailing theories in social history at the time.  The collection consists of 222 interviews with Eastern European, Irish, Italian, Russian, Scandinavian, and West Indian immigrants and black and Puerto Rican migrants, most of whom settled in New York, New York between between 1900 and 1930.  Topics discussed in the interviews include education, childhood, and early life in the narrators' countries and states of origin; arrival at Ellis Island and first impressions of New York City; assimilation; women's roles in the workforce and in the household; courtship, marriage, and  family life; processes of acquiring and retaining work; job responsibilities, wages, and working conditions; ethnic and racial makeup of different workforces, factories, and shops; labor unions and organizing in different industries; ethnic and racial relations in the community and the workplace; living conditions in different neighborhoods in New York City; politics; leisure activities; and religion."

The indices contain subject terms or phrases with the corresponding time on the recording at which they are discussed.  Some of the summaries contain a brief description of what is discussed at a certain time in the recording; others contain synopses of interview highlights without the corresponding time notes.  The interview fact sheets contain information relevant to the interests of Gutman and the project staff and were filled out by the narrators; a small amount of these were received with the donation.  The subject cards contain the same sort of information as the indices and summaries, but are typed on index cards and separated into subjects such as family, work, and education before and after immigration."

This interview covers Sedrkk Accent's life in Saint Kitts; his work as a boxer and later, a coal trimmer and fireman aboard ships; and his eventual immigration to the United States in 1963.  Accent begins by recounting his career as a boxer and how he enjoyed it.  He notes that while his first wife was very supportive of his career, often sitting in the front row during many of his matches, his second wife held little love for the sport and his involvement with it.  He describes the infidelity of his first wife; the tempestuous nature of their relationship; his discovery of her affair with a local police officer; and the violent dissolution of their marriage.  Accent describes his career as both a trimmer and a fireman aboard ships that sailed to a variety of locations including England, Italy, Greece, Canada, the Netherlands, Argentina, and Santo Domingo.  He recounts switching from trimmer to fireman because the latter was a less labor intensive job.  Despite admitting that he was not the most diligent Seventh-Day Adventist, he spends a good portion of the interview explaining the philosophy of his religion including his view of God as merciful and wonderful; the concept of doing the right thing to each and every human being; the need to lend a helping hand wherever it was needed; and the importance of upholding the Sabbath.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee also: Council Workshop for Senior Citizens I.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003cgeogname source=\"lcsh\"\u003eSaint Kitts and Nevis.\u003c/geogname\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eSeventh-Day Adventist men -- Religious life.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref850\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eAltman, Yetta: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593191\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593191\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_7dcf82b3a4d0e8352933d6a8dc49064b\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_7dcf82b3a4d0e8352933d6a8dc49064b\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e3a-3b\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_436a827e7324343fb148c2c54802d7ef\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875268]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e86\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_436a827e7324343fb148c2c54802d7ef\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e850a - 850b\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_e220ce2f8b8252ae14b18fa2d99ee529\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875276]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e87\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_e220ce2f8b8252ae14b18fa2d99ee529\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e850c\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/0rxwdjwj\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Altman, Yetta: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eAltman, Yetta: Audio Recording: Undated\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_9901ae058aed6f4d9e1ce04f576c571d\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eYetta Altman was born in Poland around 1905.

She was one of five children.  After immigrating, the family initially stayed with Artler's uncle before moving to Brooklyn, New York, where her father opened a butcher shop.  Artler attended school until she was fourteen, moving into the labor force as soon as she was able.  She worked predominantly in the garment district, making both children's and ladies' dresses, until shortly after her marriage.  Work was seasonally based, so Artler spent part of the year unemployed, varying from a month to half of the year.  While working in the factories, she became a member of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and participated in both social and union activities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/bioghist\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_3fdf0bdc8eddf9420c48b13eccad20b8\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Content Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis interview was conducted on March 7, 1975 by Louise Mayo at an unknown location.  This interview covers Bea (Gitlin) Artler's childhood in Poland; her immigration to the United States as a young child; and her life and work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Artler briefly discusses her childhood in Poland, noting her father's occupation as a butcher, before moving on to describe her memories of her initial years in New York City living in the back of her father's butcher shop.  As business declined in their initial location, Artler recalls the way in which her family moved throughout the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Artler specifically notes that they moved to better themselves, whether through better rent or living arrangements.  She briefly describes her three years of school, placing more emphasis on the various jobs she held in garment factories making feather hat ornaments, children's dresses, and the fronts of ladies' dresses.  She describes the conditions of the factories in which she worked as being acceptable, neither exceptionally dirty or crowded.  She mentions the worker demographic as being split between Italians and Jews and that the two groups got along well within the workspace.  She notes the delineation of work between men, women, and children and the tension between the manager and the employees due to his extravagant lifestyle.  Artler notes that while she originally gave all of her wages to her parents in an effort to augment the household's income, she eventually contested this agreement and kept more of the money she earned.  She discusses her membership in an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and her participation in strikes for higher wages, shorter work weeks, and greater job security, all of which the union eventually succeeded in acquiring.  She recounts participating in union sponsored social events in order to stay informed about her community and going to movies and shows with the circle of friends that she made through the union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref983\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eArtler, Bea (Gitlin): Summary\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593327\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593327\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 March 7\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_ace683a9be0443d3837ba140669e1ebb\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_ace683a9be0443d3837ba140669e1ebb\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e28\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref785\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eAuerbach, Fanny: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593131\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593131\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1973 April 18\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_dc7e33f27bdd19a86989db936fec6bec\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_dc7e33f27bdd19a86989db936fec6bec\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e4a-4b, 5\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_cfd76714cb9854868bb33b8ee6f37896\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875169]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e76\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_cfd76714cb9854868bb33b8ee6f37896\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e785a - 785c\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/6djhb359\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Auerbach, Fanny: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuerbach, Fanny: Audio Recording: 1973 April 18\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_36b7a093ee9a6c0ccb0c21e212da50ac\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eFannie Auerbach was born in Romania in 1899.

This interview covers Morris Bagno's childhood in Poland; his immigration to various European countries before, during, and after World War I; his immigration to Canada and the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in New York and California.  Bagno begins by describing his childhood in Poland, noting that the industry in his town was much smaller than in the cities that he would encounter in the US.  He explains that he received the equivalent of a college education at his local yeshiva while working with his father in the timber industry.  He describes his decision to leave Poland in 1912 in order to avoid conscription into the army and to escape his father's orthodox Judaism.  He recalls his immigration to various countries in which he lived including England, Belgium, Denmark, and Canada before his immigration to the US in 1920.  He recounts the awe he felt at seeing skyscrapers upon his arrival in New York City, which formed a stark contrast to the rural town where he grew up.  He recounts working with his uncle for a short time before deciding to find a job on his own and his his uncle's belief that he was indebted to and dependent upon him.  He recalls joining the local chapter of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, which he remarked was special for its inclusion of women as members and the fact that women could hold high positions within the union leadership.  He discusses his progression from a tailor to union delegate to supervisor and liaison between workers and employers.  He mentions that he made sure to keep his home life and his work life separate as he did not want his wife becoming involved in union affairs or interfering in his affairs.  He notes that the passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act in 1932 and the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 mitigated the effects of the Great Depression by preventing lockouts and allowing for unionization.  He recalls temporarily relocating to Los Angeles, California in 1949 at the behest of the president of the union in order to deal with the rising tension in one of the locals between the Social Democrats faction, of which he was a member, and the Communist faction, who were viewed as dangerous to the union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref14\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eBelson, Abraham\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344023\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344023\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 February 26 and March 12 \u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Card Box - 6.5 - long\" id=\"aspace_79aeb2ae30bde74399e52745537c82ca\" label=\"Access cd [31142054875417]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e101\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_79aeb2ae30bde74399e52745537c82ca\" type=\"Cd\"\u003eref14, ref14a-d\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_c7911c7329a7c7eabfade66828d24db6\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874444]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e4\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_c7911c7329a7c7eabfade66828d24db6\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e14a - 14b\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_507b074f79605814e984d04a86b3858e\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874451]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e5\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_507b074f79605814e984d04a86b3858e\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e14c - 14f\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/kd51cchv\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Belson, Abraham\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eBelson, Abraham: 1975 February 26 and March 12\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_8d1c7d6b3d952b948678c83089c79328\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbraham Belson was born in a small town near Minsk, Russia.

The location is unknown.  This interview covers Abraham Belson's childhood in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in Massachusetts and New York.  Belson begins by describing part of his father's history, recounting a time when the Russian government forced the Jewish population to convert to a religion other than Judaism and his father's refusal and subsequent draft into the army for fifteen years.  Belson recounts his membership in an unspecified Jewish club (likely the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland and Russia) aligned against the czar and the feeling that he had to work against an authority that was not concerned with his well-being.  He describes immigrating to the US; living briefly in Massachusetts; and moving to New York City where his family and many friends from his hometown lived.  He spends the rest of the interview focused on the happenings of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which he joined in 1907.  He mentions an unsuccessful strike in 1907 that lasted 13 weeks, resulting in landlords evicting families from their homes when they were unable to pay rent and the fact that they had to beg in the streets until the union was forced to compromise.  He explains that the union reorganized between 1907 and 1910 and rallied for its first large general strike in 1910.  Belson describes the camaraderie that he felt with his fellow union members; the union events they attended together; and the picnics and other outings they had during their free time.  He notes that this was common in several tight-knit communities in Brooklyn, Bronxville, and other parts of New York that were populated predominantly by ILGWU members.  He recalls becoming a union officer in 1949, emphasizing that this position required that he earn the respect of both workers and management in order to be elected and reelected every year.  Belson describes how the conditions of the workplace for garment workers improved due to union influence, noting better wages, better job hours, more job security, and the fact that workers were no longer required to rent their own machines in order to work.  He shares an anecdote about a strike in Newark, New Jersey that resulted in a prolonged stalemate between management and the union and how he and other union members strongarmed the management to cooperate with the union liaison.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eAntisemitism |z Russia |x History |y 20th century.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eInternational Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.

This interview covers Ethel Bolton's childhood in England; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1901; and her life and work in New Jersey and New York.  Topics regarding Bolton's childhood in England include her mother's death when Bolton was five years old; the subsequent immigration of her father and older siblings to the US while she remained in England with her grandfather; and her father's second marriage in the US.  Bolton describes her father's work as a printer, noting that he held various jobs at newspaper companies from the \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eReynolds's Weekly Newspaper\u003c/emph\u003e in London, England to the \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eNew York Daily News\u003c/emph\u003e and the \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/emph\u003e in New York.  She explains that he was an active member of Typographical #6 of the International Typographical Union and was involved in various strikes which resulted in food rationing for his family.  Bolton describes her dislike for her stepmother, recalling that she often faked illness so that Bolton was required to stay home from school to care for her and attributes the various relocations between New York and New Jersey to her stepmother's antagonism towards neighbors and local ministers.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBolton explains that she married Joe Bolton in 1922 after an extended courtship due to her desire to remain single and avoid the misery she saw her married friends enduring.  She recounts adopting his teenage children as her own.  She discusses the fact that her husband tended to treat her as if she were a child due to the age gap between them and that she made a point of following his rules except in voting.  She briefly recounts working as a caretaker for young children before working as a switchboard operator at two advertising agencies, the Geland Sumner Company and the Kudner Agency.  At Kudner, she describes her work in the checking department, reviewing advertisements from Nebraska to Texas.  She notes that the companies she worked for treated her extremely well, giving her bonuses at the end of the month, hosting holiday parties, and paying for a \"crying towel\" party when all of the employees over sixty-five were forced to retire.  She describes some of the jobs her husband held, which included a position at the Dictaphone Company; executive secretary at an unspecified advertising club; and a managerial position at the Empire State Building, granted to him by Alfred Smith when Bolton was unemployed during the Great Depression.  Other topics include her sister's missionary work in Africa; parts of her husband's history; her faith and involvement with the Church of Truth at Carnegie Hall in the Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eEnglish |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eAdvertising agencies -- New York (State) -- New York.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eInternational Typographical Union.

She recalls her family in Romania, including her father's work as a businessman; the fact that her mother did not work outside of the home; and her family's wealth.  She discusses her early life in the United States (US), including living with her cousin in Pittsburgh and working in his custom tailoring shop; having to hide from inspectors because she was an underage worker; and being perceived as supportive of union members during strikes, while she worked at home for her cousin.  Bottman recalls her experiences in Cleveland, including meeting and marrying her husband; keeping house rather than working; and being referred to as a baby by the other wives in the community because of her age.  She recounts her husband opening his own dress factory, where he made over 200 dollars a week and employed more than 30 people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBottman discusses her experiences in New York, including moving to the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn after her divorce; finding work as a draper and finisher; enjoying piecework over week work because she was a fast worker; marrying her second husband, who owned a laundry and tailoring shop; and fighting with him to gain his permission to work outside of the house.  She recalls that while men were often educated, women were not; that younger workers learned from the older workers who had been educated in Europe; and that one's position within the factory was partially determined by their education.

This interview covers Ernestine Brown's childhood in St. George, South Carolina; her migration to New York, New York; and her life and work as family nurse in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Brown discusses her childhood on a large plantation in St. George, where she helped grow and harvest peas, corn, cotton, and tobacco.  She notes that the plantation, granted to the family by the federal government due to her grandmother's Cherokee heritage, spread for miles and isolated them from the surrounding communities.  She explains that in order to keep the plantation self-sufficient, many of her family members assumed various roles within the community, with one of her cousins working as the schoolteacher and her great uncle and father working as preachers in the local church.  She discusses her grandmother's role as the matriarch of the family.  She recounts her move to Charleston, South Carolina, mentioning that she had never interacted with a white person before arriving in the city.  She focuses on the stifled interactions between the racial groups in the city, describing the influence of the Jim Crow laws; and the intense scrutiny that black residents faced from white police officers.  She describes the differences between the schools in St. George and in Charleston.    \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBrown describes her move to New York City, where she was reunited with her husband.

Brown recalls how her husband found work through a Civilian Conservation Corps camp, which resulted in his Army service during World War II. She explains that she was wary of her husband when he came back from the Army, having heard stories of other veterans' changed demeanor and behavior.  Brown emphasizes the changes in Harlem as a strong black community developed in the wake of white flight.  She spends a considerable amount of time noting the differences among the churches in St. George, Charleston, and Harlem, noting that St. George's preachers focused more on serving the community and the preachers in Charleston and Harlem focused on more secular matters.  Brown later describes her husband's brief, but serious illness, which resulted in multiple hospital visits before he died at home by her side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref22\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eBuono, Antonio\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344031\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344031\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003e1975 April 11\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Card Box - 6.5 - long\" id=\"aspace_8fd7ca9bd682c939191f0aa1c65ae32e\" label=\"Access cd [31142054875417]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e101\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_8fd7ca9bd682c939191f0aa1c65ae32e\" type=\"Cd\"\u003eref22\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_0cc80021f7e17e85aedf2e5da89cba9f\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874477]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e7\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_0cc80021f7e17e85aedf2e5da89cba9f\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e22a - 22b\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/2fqz675p\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Buono, Antonio\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuono, Antonio: 1975 April 11\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_0cca6ee52fe0349899cc5bdd57aaf783\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eAntonio Buono was born in 1915 in the town of Ischia, Italy.

Antonio Buono and an unidentified friend frequently converse in Italian during the interview.  This interview covers Buono's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1934; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York.  Buono begins by describing his childhood on a small farm in Italy, recalling his father's immigration to the US in 1902 and his sporadic visits to Italy.  He recounts his and his twin brother's decision to immigrate to the US and join their father in Brooklyn, where Buono worked in a small provisions factory.  He recounts his decision to work as a longshoreman because of the flexibility of the work hours and the increase in pay.  He recalls that though the job was labor intensive, the fresh air, consistent hours, and waterfront view made the job much more bearable than factory work.  He describes how joining an unspecified union (likely the International Longshoremen's Association) in 1940 helped to maintain his wages and hours and explains that there were few strikes during World War II in order to maintain the war effort.  Buono describes the relationship among the Italians in Brooklyn, many of whom were longshoremen, and notes that although the immigrants from different parts of Italy could be clannish when they socialized, they would present a united front in the workplace.  Other topics include his leisure activities and Italian traditions that were kept alive in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref24\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eBurke, William\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344033\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344033\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1974/1974\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1974 March 26 and April 2\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Card Box - 6.5 - long\" id=\"aspace_b3d7b94108c6822f48dc8092dd06bbd3\" label=\"Access cd [31142054875417]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e101\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_b3d7b94108c6822f48dc8092dd06bbd3\" type=\"Cd\"\u003eref24, ref24a-d\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_b7afb776970fd33dd6058474617a2987\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874485]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e8\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_b7afb776970fd33dd6058474617a2987\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e24\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_6cc75934441ae5ee383f7d7f7030c3c3\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874493]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e9\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_6cc75934441ae5ee383f7d7f7030c3c3\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e24\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/xpnvx6s5\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Burke, William\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eBurke, William: 1974 March 26 and April 2\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_4506928d9dcd4124a500178712eb8683\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliam Burke was born in 1905 into a large family in Abbeyknockmoy, County Galway, Ireland.

He explains that his father was the foreman of the vineyard; that a director and inspector would come from Rome every two weeks to oversee their work; and that they arranged for Caravello to attend high school.  He recounts his achievements in school proudly.  He discusses the fact that he immigrated to the US in order to work in vineyards in California but that his family and a good job in a nickel-plating factory kept him in New York City.

Cinisomo discusses his father, including his positions as sergeant major in the Italian Navy and as a sailor on a Swedish merchant marine ship, and difficulties he had while working in the US due to his height, health issues, and illiteracy.  He discusses his mother being a housewife; her work assisting other Italian immigrants in the United States (US) with their paperwork; and his parents' arranged marriage in Italy.  Cinisomo discusses his educational experiences, including graduating from public school; attending high school at night; and taking some college classes sponsored by the Works Progress Administration (WPA).  He describes his employment before the ILA, including working in a laundry, a paper box factory, and as a grocery clerk, and his employment as an organizer in the WPA from the early 1930s until the start of World War II.  He recalls social issues within the ILA, including the fact that the Irish and Germans controlled the union; that Italian workers were confined to working in the holds of the ships; and that striking was difficult because the Irish controlled the ILA and the police department.  Cinisomo discusses leisure activities in which he participated, including attending church every Sunday; playing cards on his days off; and not playing sports because he was exhausted after his shifts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee also: Canossa, Bruno;  Ferrentino, Rosario and Mario Cinisomo; and Passage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003ccorpname rules=\"dacs\" source=\"local\"\u003eInternational Longshoremen's Association.

This interview covers Elizabeth Clanton's childhood in Alabama; her migration throughout the United States (US); her work as a nurses' aide; and her union activity.  She begins by describing her childhood in Atmore, Alabama.  She focuses on how Atmore was divided along racial lines, describing segregation in neighborhoods, schools, churches, and the movies; and the limited, strained social contact between members of the white and black communities.  She also describes learning how to read in school, which enabled her to read the newspaper for her parents, neither of whom were literate.  Other topics from her childhood include her close relationship with her father; some of her grandparents' history; leisure activities; holiday traditions; the type of music to which she listened; and her religious traditions and values.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClanton explains that it was typical for parents to decide who was an appropriate match for their daughters and describes the strict rules that governed interactions between young men and women.  She describes meeting and marrying her first husband in Alabama despite her family's reservations about her being too young and her occupation as a domestic worker for various families in Atmore, a position that she acquired from her mother when the latter became ill.  She spends a great deal of time discussing her movement throughout the US, including moving to Cleveland, Ohio in order to find domestic work to support her children, whom she had left with her parents after she separated from her husband; receiving a certificate in practical nursing in Chicago, Illinois; and moving to Brooklyn, New York to live with one of her sons.  She recalls sending much of the money she earned back to her family and writing letters to her mother and children to accompany each paycheck. \n \nClanton discusses her union involvement, including being introduced to the idea of unions by organizer Jesse Olson while working at Beth Israel Hospital, as a nurses' aide, in Manhattan; going to various hotels in New York City for union meetings; discussing union activities with co-workers only on breaks or after work; and participating in a hospital workers' strike in 1959.  Clanton discusses her opinion that despite the union not supporting striking workers sufficiently she realized the benefits of belonging to a union; her appreciation of Local 1199 after her retirement; and the educational programs and social activities that Local 1199 provided.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eAfrican Americans -- Relations with Jews.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003cgeogname source=\"lcsh\"\u003eCleveland (Ohio) |x Economic conditions |y 20th century.\u003c/geogname\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eLocal 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union (New York, N.Y.)\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref791\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eCohen, Arthur: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593137\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593137\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1973 April 27\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_32fa8a0dc7806ae4c680de81a8d7c51d\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_32fa8a0dc7806ae4c680de81a8d7c51d\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e8\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_23f048c6bfd31da951c1ff9b715db97d\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875193]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e79\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_23f048c6bfd31da951c1ff9b715db97d\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e791a\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_e963153facf6d8abfee8630c2de26bfb\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875201]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e80\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_e963153facf6d8abfee8630c2de26bfb\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e791b\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/t76hdzg7\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Cohen, Arthur: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eCohen, Arthur: Audio Recording: 1973 April 27\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_8bd44841a3f281c79f2ec7faaf86a6c1\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eArthur Cohen was born in New York, New York around 1886 and was the youngest of seven sons.

Coker recounts her childhood in Hammond, Louisiana, noting that strawberry picking season interfered with her education.  She recalls Klu Klux Klan activity in her city; that white people owned many of the farms and businesses in the area; and the lynching of a woman named Emma Hooker.  She explains that her family generally had friendly relationships with white people, recalling that they lived on property owned by white people before her father built her family a house; that many people in her family were named after the family that owned the property on which they lived; and that that family sent them a wagon full of toys at Christmas.  She explains that her family moved from Hammond to Chicago, Illinois after her father lost his job for walking through a segregated railroad station and then fighting with the man who chastised him for it.  She compares Hammond and Chicago, noting that her neighborhood in Chicago was split between black residents and Polish residents but that there was no animosity between the groups.

She explains that she found various domestic worker positions through an employment agency and that she worked less frequently after having children.

The interview covers Vincent DeMatteis' family and his working life.  DeMatteis discusses his father, including his work as a real estate agent in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and his work as a longshoreman.  DeMatteis describes his own apprenticeship to a jeweler, including some of the training he received.  He discusses his decision to become a longshoreman, against his father's wishes, as he was unable to find work as a jeweler during the Great Depression.  He describes different jobs longshoremen performed, including unloading, checking, and sorting goods from ships.  He discusses differences on the waterfront between the 1930s and the time of the interview, many of them being the result of the the creation of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor in 1953 and the success of the International Longshoremen's Association in the 1960s in organizing the workers.  He discusses the structure of the work day; the way in which jobs were distributed; the way men obtained jobs as longshoremen; and the way ships were unloaded.  He discusses the ways in which longshoremen kept busy on days when there was no work; DeMatteis' household chores on those days; and the ethnic demographics of the piers in New York, most of which were controlled by Italians.  He discusses attempts at unionization on the waterfront; workers who wished for stronger unions being labeled communists; and the success of the ILA in the 1960s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003ccorpname rules=\"dacs\" source=\"local\"\u003eInternational Longshoremen's Association.

He describes the development of the longshoremen's union to which he belonged (likely the likely the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA)); the ethnic composition of the longshoremen; and the tension between Irish and Italian immigrants.  Other topics include a comparison between Brooklyn in the past and at the time of the interview; his children's occupations; his religious and political affiliations; his regret at never having returned to Italy; and his love for America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref1130\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eDeRosa, Vincenzo: Index\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593579\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593579\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1973 April 12\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_ae8ec0345c85a8a34c8ca5433a3b33c3\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_ae8ec0345c85a8a34c8ca5433a3b33c3\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e94\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref800\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eDiamond, Moe: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593145\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593145\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 March 13\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_35b77911d8141ab4e821eab461fbda11\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_35b77911d8141ab4e821eab461fbda11\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e78, 106a-b, 107\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_a500706999b7916c8f3e91f9792b6d3f\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875219]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e81\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_a500706999b7916c8f3e91f9792b6d3f\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e800a - 800b\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_f8992095d0af9060835e62670f5f7eef\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875227]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e82\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_f8992095d0af9060835e62670f5f7eef\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e800c\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/95x69wd3\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Diamond, Moe: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eDiamond, Moe: Audio Recording: 1975 March 13\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_ea16a9539aaf8a0cce1634c73019e689\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoe Diamond worked in the garment industry and was a business agent in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union in New York, New York in the early 20th century.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/bioghist\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_0fb9aabca534f22c8351e954ae1e7a82\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Content Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis interview was conducted by Frank Faragasso on March 13, 1975 at an unspecified location.

Diamond discusses the history of the ILGWU, beginning with a strike of needleworkers in 1910 and the conditions that led to the strike; the conditions at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company that contributed to the high casualty rate in the fire in 1911; the ways in which conditions in factories changed after both of these events; and the ways in which Meyer London and Morris Hillquit helped to strengthen the ILGWU.  Other topics include garment factories in which Diamond worked and the workers in the factories; the importance of the Educational Alliance in Manhattan, New York to union members in the early 20th century; changes in the garment industry between the 1910s and the 1970s; and the changes in the Garment District neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eTriangle Shirtwaist Company |y Fire, 1911.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref801\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eDiamond, Moe: Transcript\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593146\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593146\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 March 13\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_06e4f2e9901fe200cf93eef79f86b48c\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_06e4f2e9901fe200cf93eef79f86b48c\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e19\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref49\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eDuffy, Eugene R.: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344058\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344058\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1973 April 4\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_c89d7f8feba4af16abe10cc3969ca3c4\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_c89d7f8feba4af16abe10cc3969ca3c4\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e233, 233a\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Hollinger Cassette Box 9.5\" id=\"aspace_33d3cb268de7568eb96548599cda8909\" label=\"Master cassette [31142054875409]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e100\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_33d3cb268de7568eb96548599cda8909\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e49\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Card Box - 6.5 - long\" id=\"aspace_22cbb33823db0faa152c9251589116a8\" label=\"Access cd [31142054875417]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e101\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_22cbb33823db0faa152c9251589116a8\" type=\"Cd\"\u003eref49\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/hhmgqvsp\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Duffy, Eugene R.: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuffy, Eugene R.: Audio Recording: 1973 April 4\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_999b33b9603efa1f08461a094a1ad797\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eEugene R.

This interview covers Duffy's childhood in Ireland; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1929; and his life and work in the retail and transportation industries in New York, New York.  Duffy begins by describing his hometown of Dundalk, Ireland, emphasizing the town's position as a thriving railroad junction and its various industries including shoe and tobacco manufacturing (specifically P.J. Carroll \u0026amp; Company Limited).  He recalls the railroad being the major source of commerce and both his father and his grandfather working on the railroad.  He describes patterns of Irish immigration to the US, noting that many of the immigrants came from the western and southern towns in Ireland; that the Irish did not often immigrate as a family unit; the effects of religious and political conflicts on immigration; and the often contentious relationship between the Irish people and the English authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuffy describes immigrating to the US in June 1929 via the SS Leviathan, noting that he was able to bypass Ellis Island, New York due to his immigration paperwork being processed by the consulate in Dublin.  He explains that he immigrated because he had a desire to travel and he recounts living with an uncle before moving to a boarding house on East 49th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan.  He focuses on his work in the supply department at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, emphasizing the mistreatment of workers in other departments in the store; the lack of job security; and the lack of stable promotion tracks for workers.  He explains that all of these factors contributed to the union organization of retail workers in the store, specifically through Local 65 of an unspecified retail workers' union (likely the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union).  He emphasizes the fragility of the early years of the union, describing tension among members when Bloomingdale's gave the workers a raise and had the union disperse the raises from a lump sum.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuffy recalls leaving Bloomingdale's in 1943 and becoming a transportation worker and joining the Transport Workers Union of America.  He emphasizes the union's slow organizational growth over the course of the 1940s and 1950s; the conflict between Communist and non-Communist factions in the union; and the way in which the union's president, Michael Quill, dealt with the Communists' attempts to gain power.  Other topics include religious, ethnic, and racial divisions in the workforce, particularly in the retail industry, and the negative relationship between Duffy's parish church and the Communist Party of the United States of America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eTransport workers |x Labor unions |z New York (State) |z New York |x History.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eBloomingdale's (Firm)\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref331\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eEdwards, James\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344640\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344640\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003e 1974 March 27\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Card Box - 6.5 - long\" id=\"aspace_5585647b090521459455d7f3ac6d797e\" label=\"Access cd [31142054875417]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e101\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_5585647b090521459455d7f3ac6d797e\" type=\"Cd\"\u003eref331\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_e0a98014263de191f177a3c4663dfe2e\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875144]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e74\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_e0a98014263de191f177a3c4663dfe2e\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e331a - 331b\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/4mw6mh42\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Edwards, James\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdwards, James:  1974 March 27\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_9eaf058510dadfc67059c1ac24d8dbaf\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eJames Edwards was born in the early 1900s in North Carolina.

Topics of discussion include the availability and types of work for longshoremen; the hiring process and wages; and accidents on the waterfront.  Mario Cinisomo and Rosario Ferrentino discuss the different types of work done by longshoremen; the fact that each job had different levels of danger; that some jobs were dependent on the weather; and that all jobs were supervised differently by the foremen.  They recall that in the early 1920s, workers usually worked one or two days a week, increasing to three or four days a week before the Great Depression; that during the Great Depression employment opportunities were limited; that work was steady after the Great Depression; and, at the time of the interview, there was more stability in the field because of rules implemented by the ILA.  Cinisomo recalls standing on the corner of Columbia Street and President Street at five in the morning in an attempt to be hired each day, and going to each dock if he was not hired on the corner.  He explains that some workers were hired as a group rather than individually.  Ferrentino discusses occasionally working a full day but only getting paid for half and making 36 cents an hour.  Cinisomo and Ferrentino discuss workplace accidents, including winches falling out of gear and boxes falling on workers.  They discuss their belief that accidents were unavoidable in the industry and the fact that there was little or no injury compensation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee also: Canossa, Bruno; Cinisomo, Mario.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eDepressions |y 1929 |z New York (State) |z New York.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref873\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eFerrentino, Rosario and Mario Cinisomo: Subject Cards\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593214\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593214\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1974/1974\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1974 April 4\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_f65e28334ca8780de3219c0573f62c3e\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_f65e28334ca8780de3219c0573f62c3e\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e23\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref344\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eFields, [Unknown]\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"592018\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e592018\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_0760a732dbb9c9a536cee7f63c4503ca\" label=\"Master reel\" type=\"Box\"\u003eNo Master\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/3n5tb8ww\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Fields, [Unknown]\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eFields, [Unknown]: Undated\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_f5b314311b38bb982ab8dc2e31f3d4d4\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Fields was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands in the early 1900s and grew up in Vienna, Austria-Hungary.

He was one of eight children, with four brothers and three sisters.  His father made and sold glass windows.  Fox attended school in Russia for two years before apprenticing to a tailor.  He immigrated to the United States in 1906 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan, New York before moving to the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1916.

Fox's accent, his tendency to mumble, and the fluctuation of volume over the course of the interview make him hard to understand.  The interview covers Fox's childhood in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1906; and his work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Fox begins the interview by describing his childhood in Russia, focusing on anti-Semitism in his hometown, which included pogroms and abuse by the police.  He recounts not being paid during the three years of his tailoring apprenticeship and receiving meager pay for his long hours of work after his apprenticeship.  He recounts the Socialist Revolutionary Party meeting at his house and learning more about Socialism at the library until his library card was destroyed when it was learned that he was Jewish.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFox explains that he immigrated to the US in 1906 after several failed attempts to illegally cross the border into Austria in order to sail from a port in Poland.  He discusses living with his aunt's family on the East Side of Manhattan, recalling his acclimation to the spring weather and the low cost of food in New York City.  He describes his first job in a garment shop in New York City and explains that, in the beginning, he had to bring his own machine to work.  He notes that although he joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 23 in order to fight for better wages, hours, and working conditions, change was slow due to factions within the union and corruption among the union leaders.  He recalls a strike that occurred in the early 1950s, through which workers acquired a twenty percent wage increase despite conflicts with strikebreakers brought in from Chicago, Illinois.  He discusses the ILGWU opening a school to train machine operators and the union becoming more inclusive, particularly in terms of the Italian population's involvement.

There are summaries for three interviews with Ivory Gray conducted by Harris at Local 1199 on October 24, October 31, and November 7, 1975.  The interview on the recording covers Gray's initial impressions of New York, New York; his perception of the white community; and his working life in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGray explains that reading about Central Park and Cab Calloway in newspapers and experiencing the power imbalance in the sharecropping system prompted him to move to New York, New York.  He recalls warnings about the differences between people in New York and in the south, and tales of pickpockets upon his arrival in the city.  He recounts the various jobs he held before working in Montefiore Hospital, including dock worker; peddler; building superintendent and porter; and handyman.  He discusses the impact that religion had on both his and his father's lives; his father's conversion to Christianity and job as a deacon; and the church's role in disseminating and giving credence to the ideas that it was natural for black community members to feel inferior as minorities and that it was impossible to live Christian life in the northern United States (US).

He recounts not encountering much racial discrimination in the northern US but attributes this to the fact that he was poor and did not have occasion to go to places that were likely to be segregated.  He explains that he would generally stay in areas with a majority black population and not put himself in a position in which he was likely to face discrimination and prejudice, although he does recount two incidents of discrimination he faced in New York.

While in New York City, she lived in the East Village and Upper West Side neighborhoods of Manhattan and in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, where she resided at the time of the interview.

This interview covers Greenfield's childhood in Hungary; her immigration to the United States (US) in the 1920s; and her life and work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Greenfield begins the interview by discussing her love of the US, emphasizing the importance of freedom and economic opportunities.  She explains that the population of Hungary was split between the poor and the rich; that the poor could not afford to send their children to school; and that one could not marry outside of her class.  She recounts her father's conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army and capture by Russian forces in 1914; his six years as a prisoner of war; and her mother's decision to disperse her children to the care of her sisters in order to keep them safe.  She recalls her move to the Czecho-Slovak region of Austria-Hungary during the course of World War I.  She focuses on the opportunities afforded to the Jewish population there, citing her sisters' educations; free disability and sick leave benefits for workers; and Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk's policies that provided food and education for the young.  She explains that she wanted to immigrate to the US in order to attend school and aid her family but notes that her father disapproved because he believed she would lose her religion if she went. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreenfield describes the beginning of her immigration process in 1921; her initial denial of a visa when the US stemmed the flow of immigrants; and her arrival in the US via the ship Queen Mary in the late 1920s.  She explains that she originally lived with her cousins in Sunbury, Pennsylvania but moved to live with a friend on East 10th Street in Manhattan.  She describes her awe upon first observing the amount of people living in New York City and a strike that occurred the day she arrived.  She explains that she worked predominantly in the garment industry, recalling that she was not paid at her first job on 38th Street and Broadway in order to learn the trade.  She recounts her supervisor at a dress house at 1400 Broadway giving her six months' paid vacation in order to visit her family in Hungary.  She recalls joining an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and acquiring better wages and hours.  She describes earning enough money that she was able to pay her cousin back for the cost of the fare to the US and even help send her brother to university in Czechoslovakia, emphasizing the fact that she always kept her family in mind.  Other topics include the role Greenfield's parents played in developing her spirituality; her trips back to Hungary; the fate of family members that remained in Hungary during World War II; the friends she made in New York City; a comparison of Jewish children's behaviors with the behaviors of children from other religious groups; and her view regarding the refusal of many young people to go to war (presumably with Vietnam) at the time of the interview.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref899\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eGreenfield, Sylvia: Summary\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593239\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593239\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_5cdaad6cb9540a291c66be394096d4f1\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_5cdaad6cb9540a291c66be394096d4f1\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e38\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref79\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eHall, Claude and [Unknown]\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344087\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344087\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1973 May 3\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_7317ef3f38c3967763b8459e51316143\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_7317ef3f38c3967763b8459e51316143\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e211, 211a\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_88dbaddf171a9e452d04f3ea2b2a6fda\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874618]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e21\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_88dbaddf171a9e452d04f3ea2b2a6fda\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e79a - 79b\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_4fabd5cd022e3a7fa254a27882123470\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874626]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e22\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_4fabd5cd022e3a7fa254a27882123470\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e79c - 79d\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/zgmsbkmj\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Hall, Claude and [Unknown]\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eHall, Claude and [Unknown]: 1973 May 3\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_c24cd90dc4c222d7800dd5fc340c031d\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eClaude Hall immigrated to the United States from an unspecified country with his parents in 1902 and settled in Brooklyn, New York.

She was one of five children.  Her father worked as a merchant in Kiev and died when she was seven years old.  After she was widowed, her mother ran a small restaurant to support her family.  Heltzer attended school in Kiev until she was 15 years old, when she became a live-in apprentice to a furrier in Kiev.  She immigrated to the United States in 1906 when she was 17 years old.  She initially lived with her sister on Houston Street in Manhattan, New York before moving in with a friend in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  She attended a practical nursing class at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan from 1907 to 1908 and married in September 1909.  She moved to Shelton, Connecticut during World War I; moved to Worcester, Massachusetts to accommodate her husband's business venture; and moved back to New York City in 1921 when that venture failed.  They moved often, living in the Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen, and Harlem neighborhoods of Manhattan before settling in the Bronx in 1927.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeltzer worked as a machine operator and finisher in various shops in the garment industry, making dresses, sweaters, bathing suits, and corsets.

The date and location of this interview are unknown.  This interview covers Fanny Heltzer's childhood in Russia; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1906; and her work in the garment industry and as a private nurse in New York, New York.  Heltzer begins the interview by describing her childhood in Kiev, noting that conversations regarding politics were forbidden in school; that she acquired her Socialist viewpoints from family and friends; and that she attended secret Socialist meetings.  She recalls that her mother paid for her to be a live-in apprentice to a furrier in Kiev because her sister noted the high-paying opportunities in that industry in the US.  She describes her mother sending Heltzer's oldest sister to the US in the hopes that she would eventually be able to send for the rest of the family.  She explains that her brother was sent to Siberia due to his revolutionary activity and that their mother sent him to the United States in order to prevent his being arrested again.  She notes that she immigrated soon after him in 1906, with their two remaining sisters following her.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeltzer explains that she initially lived with her sister on Houston Street in Manhattan but moved in with a friend because of her sister's overbearing rules.  She explains that she acquired her first job in a ladies' shirtwaist shop through the recommendation of a friend, noting her initial fear of the speed and noise of the electric sewing machines; that the conditions of the shop were filthy; and that she quit because of the poor conditions and the long work week.  She explains that her next jobs in Manhattan, in a dress shop and at the Nemo Corset Company, were better due to the cleaner conditions in the shops.  She notes that employees at the Nemo Corset Company were afraid to organize and join a union because of the potentially hostile reaction from management.  She emphasizes the development of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union during her time in various garment shops, noting the union's cocern over working conditions and lack of job security.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeltzer recalls joining a dramatic club where she met her husband, emphasizing her and her husband's involvement with plays and the club's choral group.  She recalls that her husband worked as a watchmaker but also had other business ventures.  Heltzer describes moving to Shelton, Connecticut during World War I and later to Worcester, Massachusetts as her husband changed jobs.  She explains that he invested in cotton goods and lost nearly all of this money in a failed business venture in Worcester, prompting the family to move back to New York City.  She describes working as a machine operator for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) through which she joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) and the Workers' Unemployed Union (WUU), established in New York City by the Socialist Party of America.  She recalls moving through various neighborhoods in New York City in order to find better employment and living conditions, focusing on her time working in her husband's jewelry store on 41st Street and 10th Avenue.  She explains that a robbery in the store affected her husband's physical and mental health, prompting her to work at the store by herself for two years before closing it.  She emphasizes her family's involvement in and bonding through the Socialist Party, noting that her children grew up around party events due to her and her husband's labor union and other party activities.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther topics include a nursing course Heltzer took at Beth Israel Hospital; her children's education and occupations; a comparison of her experiences as a single woman during the 1908 depression and with a family during the Great Depression; the ethnic demographics of the different national and religious groups of the neighborhoods in which she lived and the shops in which she worked; and her work as an unlicensed private nurse until 1965.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eWomen socialists |z New York (State) |z New York.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref901\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eHeltzer, Fanny: Summary\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593241\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593241\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_4a9d091e05f2072e1889a94b743e2898\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_4a9d091e05f2072e1889a94b743e2898\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e40\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref903\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eHenning, Astrid: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593242\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593242\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 May 7\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_c1923bf2f94c061369322278e044eb5a\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_c1923bf2f94c061369322278e044eb5a\" type=\"Cd\"\u003e256, 256a-c\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_9011645b7b2187770708e84c28e43c29\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875367]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e96\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_9011645b7b2187770708e84c28e43c29\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e903a - 903d\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_ef2944094ef743ccad1c52a58e86e5cf\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875375]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e97\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_ef2944094ef743ccad1c52a58e86e5cf\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e903e - 903g\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/931zczq7\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Henning, Astrid: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eHenning, Astrid: Audio Recording: 1975 May 7\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_c83bd62544290a38d90d208a52140bb8\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eAstrid Henning was born in Norway.

She describes the staff in the different houses in which she worked, including the responsibilities of each staff member; the types of people that were successful in domestic service; and advice she received from co-workers.  She compares the behavior of different ethnic groups in domestic service and her disapproval of the Irish workers, who would swear  while on duty and play cards late at night.  She describes the food that was provided for the staff at different houses in which she worked, including one in which the staff was provided only with leftovers until Henning complained.  She recounts being repeatedly subjected to sexual harassment by male employers and warning the men that she would quit if the behavior continued.

She compares the living situation of minorities in downtown Manhattan to those in Harlem and her belief that the conditions downtown were more primitive than those in Hampton.

The recording begins with an introduction to the project by Scott Weir, and an unidentified female interviewer explains that the recording addresses the experiences of three groups:  Eastern European Jews; Italians; and African-American migrants from the southern United States (US).

She describes the social, economic, and political conditions that prompted many Eastern European Jews to immigrate to the US and interview excerpts follow discussing anti-Semitism, religious traditions, and education.  Weir gives a brief history of Italian immigration to the US, and interview excerpts that follow discuss the economic contrast between landowners and agricultural laborers in Italy, and the fact that many Italians expected to return to Italy once they had enough money.  The last section of the recording contains interview excerpts discussing the history of African Americans from Reconstruction to the 1970s; racial discrimination; the sequence of family migration; and ethnic relations among people in different New York City neighborhoods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee also:  Fox, Abe; Robinson, Irene; Savio, Joseph; Unknown African-American Man; Wagner, Frank; Walters, [Unknown].\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref329\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eIntroduction to Project\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344638\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344638\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_c147d037cadeecea992f18f6097385c1\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_c147d037cadeecea992f18f6097385c1\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e183\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_5994b23d1ce3d6d033349d51ca0a35a9\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875144]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e74\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_5994b23d1ce3d6d033349d51ca0a35a9\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e329a\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/d51c5j38\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Introduction to Project\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eIntroduction to Project: Undated\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_6b6937196518524ad4f34842a8df3b6c\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Content Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeon Fink, at the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Local 22, explains that students in the Department of History at the City College of New York have undertaken a project to record the history of New York from the point of view of working people, specifically immigrants who came to the United States between 1900 and 1930.

Ippolito discusses his family's staggered immigration to the US; his father's immigration seven years before the rest of the family; and his father's work to bring the rest of the family to the US.  He discusses leaving school to join the workforce; working in a bed factory and being told he was too young for that type of work; and finding a job in the furniture industry through a friend.  He recounts joining the United Furniture Workers of America Local 76; participating in strikes; and losing a job as a result of one of the strikes.  He recounts working in a factory producing radio and television cabinets; switching to war production during World War II and making uniforms for the United States Army; and returning to production of television and radio cabinets after the war.  He lists furniture plants in which he worked; the dates of his employment; and the types of furniture each produced.  Ippolito and his wife describe the changes in the ethnic composition of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn between the early 20th century and in the 1960s when they decided to move to Ridgewood.

He describes his life after immigration, including arriving in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but immediately moving to Baltimore, Maryland to stay with a family friend; attending night school in Baltimore to learn English; training to be a cutter in the garment industry and being paid five dollars a week; joining the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union (ACWA) Local 15 in Baltimore; and moving to New York City  in order to find work when his Local went on strike.  Katz discusses his employment after migrating to New York, including transferring to the ACWA Local 4; being paid double what he received in Baltimore; attending an unspecified design school at night; and working seasonally.  He discusses his union involvement in detail, including his attendance at weekly meetings; his participation in votes regarding strikes; the lack of strength of the union in regards to negotiation with businesses; and the fact that the ACWA provided educational programs for its members.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref912\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eKimberg, Lena: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593252\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593252\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 February 24 and March 17\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_a5b576ba93f92f5bf9e3a25a18f5ec4e\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_a5b576ba93f92f5bf9e3a25a18f5ec4e\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e116-117\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_83e377739e62bc187559334d3b6b2370\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875383]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e98\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_83e377739e62bc187559334d3b6b2370\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e912a - 912b\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_dfcf7a887990026a487795b66978b880\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875391]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e99\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_dfcf7a887990026a487795b66978b880\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e912c - 912d\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/s1rn8ws2\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Kimberg, Lena: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eKimberg, Lena: Audio Recording: 1975 February 24 and March 17\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_e021179bbbaa48c1d1649a505e4f8973\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eLena Kimberg was born near Vilna, Russia in 1892.

The interview covers Rose Kriemer's family and childhood in Russia, her immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and her union activity.  Kriemer discusses her family and childhood in Russia, including her father's occupation as a teacher in Kiev and the family's small farm.  She describes working in the US after her immigration and wanting to attend school, but being unable to do so as she was required to work overtime in order to keep her job.  She recounts returning to work in order to provide better opportunities for her children.  She describes the first factory in which she worked, including the decent working conditions; her salary; one strike in which she participated that brought in an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada); changes in working conditions and salaries after the factory was unionized; and her return to the factory after her children started school.  She describes herself as a fast worker and able to make a good living with piece work.  She describes the abilities of the other workers in relation to herself; the types of jobs in the factory; and the division of labor between men and women.  She discusses the system of work in the factory; the fact that some workers brought work home in order to make more money through the piece work system; and her decision to bring this to the notice of the supervisors.  She describes seasonal work, including working overtime from January to April and working two or three days a week the rest of the year.   She explains that most problems in the factory existed between the workers since the unions taught the members how to get along with management.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther topics include her dislike of Communists; the deaths of her family in Russia and the acquisition of their land by the Bolsheviks; and her confusion over the reason for their deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eInternational Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.

She attended school while occasionally working in the same textile factory as her parents and in domestic service.  Her father sent her and her siblings to Vienna, Austria so that they could avoid the hazards of factory work.  She immigrated to the United States in 1922.  She lived in different neighborhoods in New York, New York.

The audio recording for this interview is missing.  Kearns notes that Kuthan had been frequently interviewed for local media and museums, and wrote a column in a nationally circulated Czech magazine.  The interview covers Kuthan's childhood and adolescence in Austria-Hungary and Czechoslovakia; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1922; and her work in domestic service in both Europe and New York.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKuthan describes the class structure in her hometown and compares the labor and conditions of the textile factory in which she and her family worked to the labor and conditions of the African-Americans who worked on plantations in the southern US.  She explains that her father was married twice and relates stories of how he met both of his wives.  She mentions that her father saved his money to send his children to Vienna, Austria, where he believed they had a better chance to be healthy and successful.  She describes her jobs in domestic service and recalls thinking that the US was a great country after retrieving American Red Cross food packages at a post office for one of her employers.

She describes finding work through a Czech employment agency on First Avenue between 72nd and 73rd Streets in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan and notes that Czech women often went into domestic work because they had no relatives in the US and thus needed a place to stay.  She recalls moving rapidly from one domestic service job to another in order to learn new things and improve her wages. She explains that many immigrants married because they wanted to have their own homes and to alleviate their homesickness.  She describes her marriage; her management of the household budget; and the family outings they took once her daughter was born.  Other topics from her time in the US include her first impressions of New York City; occupations of Czech immigrants and neighborhoods and areas where they lived; her husband's work as a carpenter; the differences between men and women's jobs in the household; and her love of food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eWorld War, 1914-1918 -- Austria\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref1134\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eKuthan, Anna: Summary\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593583\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593583\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1976/1976\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1976 March 18 and April 4\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_fd19afca467a4be4826c433282bbbbf5\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_fd19afca467a4be4826c433282bbbbf5\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e98\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref111\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eLacowsky, [Unknown]\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344119\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344119\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_9fc6741abdf763812ad67681c32f2e7d\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_9fc6741abdf763812ad67681c32f2e7d\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e113\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_06d33d051a4fc10a1b32394aac332a2c\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874691]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e29\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_06d33d051a4fc10a1b32394aac332a2c\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e111a\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_47809031d8ca85d994ca1a79eeae1680\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874709]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e30\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_47809031d8ca85d994ca1a79eeae1680\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e111b\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/wm37q2xz\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Lacowsky, [Unknown]\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eLacowsky, [Unknown]: Undated\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_f508782ac5ce7785bf38813089febf8b\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Lacowsky was born in Russia in the late 19th century.

She describes her work as a secretary for a prestigious banker and how his competitors tried to poach her while he was away.  She explains that she did not encounter racial prejudice in Colombia, but that there were distinctions along gender and class lines and that she was viewed as different because it was not customary for women to work.  She explains that she returned to Jamaica when she contracted malaria and from there immigrated to the United States (US) in 1921, originally intending to stay only six months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLynch recalls being astounded by racial prejudice in the US and relates the differences between people's behavior in the US and in Colombia.

Topics in this interview include Danny Meyers' family, his experience driving a taxi, and the process of unionizing taxi drivers.  Meyers discusses his family, including the fact that his father died when Meyers was seven; the fact that his family was very religious; and the fact that his family would have prefered that he had chosen a different profession.  He discusses the fact that his children continued to practice their Jewish faith as adults and the fact that he felt proud that all of his children had graduated from college.  He recollects his career driving a taxi, including starting during the Great Depression so that he would not have to ask for government assistance; being robbed and assaulted many times during his career; and playing cards with the other taxi drivers after a shift. Meyers recounts driving Fiorello La Guardia to a meeting at 3:00 in the morning and how this interaction led to La Guardia being the only politician that Meyers ever supported.  Meyers discusses in detail multiple attempts at unionization of taxi drivers; the support given by John L. Lewis, Mike Quill, and Jimmy Hoffa; the effects of these attempts; and his speculation as to why they were unsuccessful until 1966.  He elaborates on the benefits of unionization, including no longer needing to bribe the dispatcher in order to get a vehicle for the day; gaining larger commissions on each fare; creating solidarity within the taxi driving community; and believing that unionization was greatly beneficial to taxi drivers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eTaxicab drivers |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"local\"\u003eNew York City Taxi Drivers Union, Local 3036\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref142\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eMiller, Alex\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344150\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344150\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 March 7, March 14, and March 21\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_04a02f147ccea8b22f74088e751e70fd\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_04a02f147ccea8b22f74088e751e70fd\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e125a-b, 126a-b, 127a-b, 128a-b, 129\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_1c480e39748fd32ef327e53543917748\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874816]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e41\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_1c480e39748fd32ef327e53543917748\" type=\"Box\"\u003e142a - 142d\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_5665b73cb99bed98d8630e2f6df804c0\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874824]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e42\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_5665b73cb99bed98d8630e2f6df804c0\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e142e - 142i\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_45a1aa70febd29e0db71916fc9b470b2\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874832]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e43\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_45a1aa70febd29e0db71916fc9b470b2\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e142j\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/nvx0kdmx\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Miller, Alex\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eMiller, Alex: 1975 March 7, March 14, and March 21\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_c7f6db5480e3a370116f16f870f01186\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlex Miller was born in Dobromil in Austrian Galicia to a Jewish family.

Miller discusses his early life in Dobromil, including his mother working as a seamstress in order to support the family; her requiring him to attend school even though the family was poor; and not completing apprenticeship as a tailor.  He recalls his early work in the garment industry, including getting his first job through his brother-in-law; beginning as a non-union employee because he did not have enough experience or training; refusing to work on Saturdays; having to borrow money from his brother-in-law to buy his first union dues book; and looking for new work consistently, due to the seasonal nature of the garment industry. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMiller discusses his involvement in the ILGWU, including his participation in strikes in 1913, 1916, 1919, and 1926; his multiple arrests for picketing during the 1916 strike; and his failed attempt to keep his sons away from union work. He discusses his election to multiple positions within the union, including assistant manager of the ILGWU Local 9; the manager of the Organizational Department; and a member of the Out-of-Town Department. He recalls the types of work he did within each position, including attempting to organize non-union shops; working with shop owners to keep union members employed; acting as a liaison between shop owners and union members; and passing all of his decisions in front of a union board so that no one could accuse him of corruption.  He discusses his involvement with the Socialist Party of America, including joining in 1914 in order to learn more about the movement; leaving the party when the Communist movement gained momentum, though still supporting Socialist ideals; and re-joining the party around 1940.  He briefly recounts his involvement with the Workmen's Circle in Manhattan, including being pushed to run for office; being minimally active due to time constraints with his work at the ILGWU; and appreciating that he was provided with excellent medical care throughout his membership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eInternational Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.

She explains that she loves the United States (US) to the point where she would erase her Russian heritage if she could, recalling the often violent discrimination against Jews in Russia, and how this prompted her sister's immigration to the US.  She describes her immigration to the United States in 1912 and her work with her sister to earn enough money to send for their mother in 1914.  She recalls that her aunt helped her get her first job as a seamstress on Manhattan Avenue in New York City, noting that she was instructed to hide in the bathroom whenever a customer entered the shop because she looked too young to be working.  She recalls her membership in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 25; the organization of local garment shops; and strikes for better wages, which were often defeated by strikebreakers brought in by the employers.  She describes having an especially strong bond with Italian immigrants due to their shared immigrant experience and their work together membership in the ILGWU.  She recalls Communists attempting to infiltrate and disrupt the ILGWU by discussing irrelevant topics at meetings and fainting during organizational events.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJacob Newman begins by describing his grandfather's wealth, which he acquired through his ready-made clothing business.  He recounts Communists taking his father's inheritance and this prompting his family's immigration to the US in search of better economic and educational opportunities.  He recalls his family wanting him to become a shochet, a person trained to slaughter animals according to Jewish law, but studying electrical engineering through the International Correspondence School instead.  He explains that General Electric would not hire him due to his Jewish heritage and so he sought work in the garment industry.  He recounts moving to Greenville, South Carolina at the behest of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in order to augment the development of the garment industry and the ACWA's presence in the southern US; sending his paychecks back to his family in New York; and visiting his family every two or three months.  He endeavors to explain his love of the southern US by describing the environment and the people, emphasizing his belief that African-Americans in the south were very educated.  Molly Newman frequently interjects with her disdain for the southern United States.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther topics include Communist activity in the US, particularly in labor unions; conditions during the Great Depression in New York City; race discrimination in the southern US; the benefits of membership in the Workmen's Circle; a comparison of the immigrant population in New York City in the past and at the time of the interview; the Newmans' 50th wedding anniversary party and the anniversary money they donated to the Women's American Organization for Rehabilitation through Training (ORT); and their daughter's education.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eWomen socialists |z New York (State) |z New York.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eInternational Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.

He immigrated to the United States (US) in 1921 and lived with his brother in New York, New York.  He worked as a fur machine operator in both Hungary and the US.  He was a member of an unspecified union in the US (likely the International Fur and Leather Workers Union) and was an executive board member of the national union and chairman of his local.

This interview covers Isidore Opochinsky's life in Hungary; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1921; his work as a fur machine operator in New York, New York; and his union activity.  Opochinsky tends to mumble and is sometimes hard to understand.  He provides few details about his childhood and early life in Europe, focusing on his involvement in the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia.  He recalls that he learned of the importance of unionization and the tenets of Socialism through members of the Bund.  He notes that members of the Bund who immigrated to the US had an easier time acclimating because they had the resources and social ties of an organized group.  He explains that he worked without pay for six months while he trained in the fur industry in Europe.  He recounts immigrating to the US in 1921, because he could not make a living in Europe after World War I, and settling with his brother in New York, New York.  He explains that he returned to Europe after a conflict with an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur and Leather Workers Union).  He discusses his return to the United States when he could not find work in Europe and his vow to rid the union of those in power who monopolized its funds and activities.  He recalls neglecting his education and his family in order to reorganize the leadership of the union, noting that after his removal of the corrupt leaders, the resulting chaos provided an opportunity for the Communists gain power.  He describes a strike that occurred in 1926, including the fact that it lasted 26 weeks; that the police killed many of the strikers; and that the strikers won, earning medical benefits and better hours and wages.  Other topics include details of the work of the fur industry; a comparison of labor unions and living and working conditions in Europe and the US; and his attendance and involvement in an unspecified conference concerned with Jewish labor issues in Geneva, Switzerland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eJewish socialists -- New York (State) -- New York -- Interviews.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eLabor unions -- Officials and employees -- United States.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eAllgemeyner Idisher arbayṭerbund in Liṭa, Poylen un Rusland\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003ccorpname rules=\"dacs\" source=\"naf\"\u003eWorkmen's Circle (U.S.)\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eInternational Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref946\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eOpochinsky, Isidore: Summary\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593286\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593286\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003e1975 April 19\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_88329190235db713f633d599d5548784\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_88329190235db713f633d599d5548784\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e65\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref156\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003ePane, Frank\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344164\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344164\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 April 30\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_0455167b0bee7b76a19f42b63a71f645\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_0455167b0bee7b76a19f42b63a71f645\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e170\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_d62de904af994976a8b5a4cb6bf8704b\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874865]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e46\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_d62de904af994976a8b5a4cb6bf8704b\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e156a - 156b\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/cfxpp34v\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Pane, Frank\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003ePane, Frank: 1975 April 30\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_df8aecb710eb06801a2015e181bd7ae8\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eHistorical/Biographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrank Pane was born on March 21, 1891 in Sorrento, Italy.

Pane started working as a bookbinder after his father was injured at work.  He worked in the printing department but also functioned as an intermediary between the predominantly Italian lithograph operators and management.  He shifted to working as a ship caulker during World War II.

In addition to Frank Pane, there is an unknown man who intermittently comments on the interviewers' questions.  This interview covers Pane's childhood in Italy, his immigration to the United States, and his life and work as a bookbinder and longshoreman in New York, New York.  Pane discusses his family history, noting the contrast between his father, who was a relatively poor longshoreman, and his mother, who had inherited two large homes from her parents.  He recounts how his father's schooner was destroyed by a steamboat while at sea and how the steamboat crew, who were headed to the United States, brought him with them, and he settled in New York in order to acquire more job opportunities.  Pane and the rest of his family immigrated to the United States later in 1898 via the ship Victoria.  He describes the poor living conditions that many immigrants, including his family, endured.  He notes that during the the depressions before and after World War I, Father Vogel at the Saint Charles Chapel on Van Brunt and President Streets in Brooklyn, New York would distribute food and coal tickets to poor families.  He describes evading the draft during World War II in order to support his family and shifting his occupation from bookbinder to work as a caulker in the shipyards.  He notes that he liked the work due to the outdoor environment, a stark contrast to the dirty factories that he had worked in as a bookbinder, but disliked the inconsistent employment.  Pane emphasizes the politics of New York City, specifically the relationship between Democratic and Republican policies during the Great Depression.  He ascribes the depressions of the early 20th century to the Republican administrations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eBookbinders |z United States |v Interviews.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref157\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003ePassage\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344165\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344165\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_b69fdd417f183bad3f297a2b0301a793\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_b69fdd417f183bad3f297a2b0301a793\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e242\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_e3e93fac324789de14a06b2b51b78e50\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874873]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e47\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_e3e93fac324789de14a06b2b51b78e50\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e157a\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/7pvmd2mh\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Passage\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003ePassage: Undated\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_bc13ab3b4b0eb3f75ab28e32e00a2a63\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Content Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis recording contains excerpts of interviews containing narrators' experiences of the immigration process.

This interview covers Reid's childhood in Jamaica; his immigration to the United States (US); and work as a carpenter in Charleston, South Carolina and New York, New York.  Reid begins by describing his childhood in Jamaica, noting that his grandfather owned a blacksmithery and a farm that was relatively self-sufficient, growing produce and raising livestock for the family.  Reid describes his time at Mt. Zion School, noting his position as a teacher's aide once he reached the upper levels of elementary school and the fact that his mother wanted him to become a teacher, an occupation he had little interest in pursuing.  He discusses the history and genealogy of parts of his family and race relations in Jamaica.  He explains that when he was 16 years old, he became an apprentice to carpenters employed by his cousin, noting that he learned general carpentry and built houses and factories in Jamaica.  Reid explains that he immigrated to the US in 1919 and acclimated to the United States in Charleston, South Carolina with a different cousin because of the warm weather there.  He describes encountering segregation in the southern United States, noting that he ignored these restrictions with few repercussions.  He describes working for the Standard Oil Company and recalls the racial segregation of the workforce.  He recounts joining Local 52 of an unspecified carpenters' union in Charleston; its two locals organized by race; and the specific territories marked for where each local's members were allowed to work.  Reid provides an extended description of his job with the Consolidated Gas Company in Charleston, noting the details of his work and his relationship with the foreman.  He discusses his work at an unspecified company in New York owned by Philip Egensky.

The interview covers Evadni Richards' early life in Jamaica, her immigration to the United States (US), her work in the garment industry, and her union activity.  Richards discusses her early life in Jamaica, including her education at a dressmaking school in Kingston and her decision to immigrate to Cuba with a friend.  She discusses working as a domestic worker and companion in Cuba before immigrating to the US in 1922.  She discusses her brother's business as a shoemaker in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan and his illness, which led to his return to Jamaica in 1924 and left her alone in the US.  She discusses her work in the garment industry, including her wages; her work in the designing room doing handwork; and the other West Indians who worked in the factory with her.  She compares Jamaica and New York from her childhood and the 1920s, in particular that there was no segregation in schools or churches; the influence of colonialism in the workplace; and that wages were better in New York, despite still being relatively little.  She discusses discrimination in the garment industry; her opinion that all workers, regardless of race or ethnicity, faced a certain amount of discrimination; and racial discrimination she faced in the garment industry, in particular not being allowed to work as a designer despite her training.  She recounts being chosen to learn to operate a special sewing machine despite being the only black worker in the factory.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRichards discusses early organizing attempts of the ILGWU in the early 1930s; her participation in strikes before she was a member of the union; and the differences in pay and working conditions after she joined the union.  She discusses cultural programs organized by the ILGWU, in particular Fannia Cohn and her Know Your City program; an orchestra and dance troupe organized by the union; the popularity of these programs with the general public; her participation in the chorus; and the participation of the chorus and orchestra in the 1939-1940 New York World's Fair.  She discusses the union's abandonment of funding of these programs in 1946 in favor of their cooperative housing programs.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther topics include Richards' attendance at a singing school in the Bronx and her membership in an opera troupe; the immigration of her siblings to various countries; her decision to not become a US citizen until after her husband's death in 1966; her childhood in the interior of Jamaica; and her relationships with her extended family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee also:  Immigration, Migration, and First Impressions of New York, New York and the United States; Life Before Immigration or Migration; Leisure; and Neighborhood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn electronic transcript of this interview is available by request.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref952\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eRichards, Evadni: Index\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593292\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593292\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1973 March 28\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_fc50ab7174a7bf7abe46f631f1d4bcf6\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_fc50ab7174a7bf7abe46f631f1d4bcf6\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e70\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref168\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eRief, Fannie: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344176\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344176\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1973 April 2\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_585e63d6794328130278a78236b1a549\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_585e63d6794328130278a78236b1a549\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e34\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_0ab8a1e1c4f6340c4b950238c60350b4\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874907]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e50\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_0ab8a1e1c4f6340c4b950238c60350b4\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e168a\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_93d1da99486ab8329ffbf749da75268b\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874915]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e51\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_93d1da99486ab8329ffbf749da75268b\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e168b\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/z612jth3\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Rief, Fannie: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eRief, Fannie: Audio Recording: 1973 April 2\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_0aaa800bce319a9ecd72cd77d384aa11\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eFannie Rief was born in 1890 in a small town in southern Austria.

She was an only child.  Her father died when she was young and her mother traveled often, leaving her with her aunt.  She attended a church school and studied  typing and Pitman shorthand in the Kingston section of Georgetown, British Guiana.  She immigrated to the United States in March 1924, initially settling in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York with her friend's sister.  She married on May 3, 1925 in a Lutheran church on 126th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem and later moved to Brooklyn.  Her husband was from King and Queen County, Virginia.  They had five children.  She worked as a transit clerk and as a machine operator in the garment industry.  She belonged to Local 140 of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union).

The date is unknown.  This interview covers Robinson's childhood in British Guiana; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1924; and her life and work in New York, New York.  Robinson begins by describing her childhood in Plaisance, British Guiana, recalling how discipline and the desire to make something of herself were instilled in her through her household chores, education, and corporal punishment.  She describes the racial demographics of her classmates as being mostly black but not feeling animosity between the black and East Indian populations of British Guiana; and not experiencing racial discrimination and prejudice until she lived in the US.  She discusses Great Britain's relationship with British Guiana and her work as secretary in a Marcus Garvey club in British Guiana.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRobinson recalls wanting to come to the US because she had heard that American stenographers earned good wages.  She describes her journey to the US in March 1924, during which she felt seasick and alone, and nearly died when her ship sank.  She recalls living with her friend's sister on 128th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan and her awe at seeing snow for the first time.  She recounts a trip she and her husband took to the southern US after they were married, focusing on her initial experience with racial discrimination in the US and how it made her wary of people.  She describes moving near Linden Boulevard in Brooklyn  in order to provide a safer environment and better educational opportunities for her children.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRobinson explains that she went into factory work because the hours allowed her to care for her children and that one of her friends taught her to operate a sewing machine.  She recalls working for various garment factories and joining Local 140 of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union), which supported members financially during strikes and helped them achieve better working conditions and wages.  She emphasizes the role of the Anglican Church throughout her life and her children's experiences at Greater Refuge Temple in Harlem.  Other topics include the life, education, and work of her five children; her and cousins' appearances as a singing group, the Robinson Children, on various New York City radio stations; her husband's occupations; a comparison of parenting methodologies between her generation and the generation of parents at the time of the interview; and her travels since her retirement in 1967.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee also:  Life Before Immigration or Migration; Immigration, Migration, and First Impressions of New York, New York and the United States; Interview Compilation for Radio Broadcast; and Passage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eGuyanese |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref954\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eRobinson, Irene: Index\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593294\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593294\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1973 April 7\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_687bb6cbaa86969249553f96b57165b5\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_687bb6cbaa86969249553f96b57165b5\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e72\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref50\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eRocco, Dominick: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344059\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344059\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_1c73150b0037385e9173aeb3dd9a18be\" label=\"Master reel\" type=\"Box\"\u003eNo Master\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_73dbfb2014f2fc1fa15119410ecc8df2\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_73dbfb2014f2fc1fa15119410ecc8df2\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e151\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Card Box - 6.5 - long\" id=\"aspace_d141af9eaa452f7d130ae24f20a217a9\" label=\"Access cd [31142054875417]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e101\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/crjdfv9s\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Rocco, Dominick: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eRocco, Dominick: Audio Recording: Undated\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_52367f383729eb6eed8077b0ec87f7da\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eDominick Rocco was born in Procida, Italy on July 13, 1901.

This interview covers Dominick Rocco's childhood in Procida, Italy; his illegal immigration to the United States (US) in 1924; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York.  Rocco begins the interview by describing his childhood in Italy; his father's cargo ship business; and the changes in Procida from when he left to the time of the interview, noting an increase in educational opportunities and a decrease in the number of people employed in labor-intensive jobs.  He discusses being encouraged to immigrate to the US after seeing the success of his father's workers who would go to the US and return to Italy wealthier.  He explains that his immigration in July 1924 impeded him from acquiring his citizenship until 1948.  He recounts his settling on 2nd Street in Brooklyn with his cousin's family and immediately working as a longshoreman.  He recalls joining the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) but notes that its early incarnations were weak and indistinct due to its lack of communication and organization, especially during the Great Depression.  He discusses the fact that longshoremen were predominantly Italian and notes that the large need for the occupation dwindled over time and will perhaps completely disappear in the future.  He describes living in a predominantly Italian neighborhood in which there were many large families of four to five children and that the older generations made sure to pass the traditions of their homeland to the next generation.  Other topics include his marriage and subsequent move to 49th Street and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn in 1929; his first time taking the 7th Avenue subway in 1924; and his belief in building a better life for himself in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref1138\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eRocco, Dominick: Subject Cards\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593587\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593587\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_30ea110982590726c87b8beb0a0ccac8\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_30ea110982590726c87b8beb0a0ccac8\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e104\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref170\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eRockwell, Alfonso: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344178\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344178\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_e557e1afa79dff0755108017aee63deb\" label=\"Audio\" type=\"Box\"\u003eMissing\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_56a1d6d002992b519f3c90d94f589e16\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlfonso Rockwell was born in North Cumberland County, Virginia in 1907.

Rockwell describes his hometown, noting his work on the family farm and differences in the town between his childhood and the time of the interview.  He notes that there was a distinction between men's work and women's work, with men fishing and women working on the farms or in tomato factories.  He explains that he left Virginia when he was 16 years old because he had heard that jobs and wages were better in Atlantic City.  He describes working in construction in Ocean City, New Jersey; liking the lack of a union; marrying his first wife; and going to baseball games, pool rooms, dances, and church during his free time.  He discusses segregation in his neighborhood; transitioning from construction work to cooking for job security; and his preference for the Postal Savings System over banks.  He describes moving to New York; working odd jobs because of the lack of steady work; and returning to Virginia when his grandmother became sick.

The location is likely the Carroll Gardens Senior Center at 380 Court Street in Brooklyn, New York.  Many people can be heard conversing over one another and passing in and out of the room, making the current narrator hard to hear.  Several other people were present at this interview including Frances and Rose, who are only identified by their first names; Lily (likely Lily Campanile); an unspecified man who acts as a translator between the interviewer and Stella Loregio; and several other unidentified women.  This interview covers the history of  Adele Rosanno's father; Rosanno's life in Brooklyn, New York; parts of Stella Loregio's life and work; and several unnamed participants' stories of their lives and work experiences in the United States (US).  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRosanno begins by describing her father; his immigration to the US from Italy in 1889; and his inheritance of his father's farm in the Abruzzi region of Italy.  She describes his struggle to find work as a cabinetmaker in the US, noting that he worked on the subway in New York City before getting a job at E. B. Jordan, a furniture company, where he later became a floor manager.  Rosanno recounts meeting her husband at a masquerade dance; working as a manager in his restaurant on Houston Street; and monitoring the bar and wait staff as they had a tendency to steal from the business.  Other topics from Rosanno's portion of the interview include her family and their educations and occupations; her job as a saleswoman; and her involvement with the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary \u0026amp; Saint Stephen Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRosanno introduces her friend, identified as Rose, who discusses the types of community organizations in Carroll Gardens and emphasizes the role of religious organizations.  She notes that many of the volunteers were older women who no longer worked, but needed  to socialize and keep busy.  She focuses on the contributions of those in the Jeanmen's Guild of Saint Agnes Church and the volunteer work that went into making bed jackets for Saint Rose's Free Home for Incurable Cancer at 71 Jackson Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of the women describe their impressions of how the role of women has changed since they were young women, specifically noting the increasing number of women in the workforce.  One woman recalls working as a telephone operator until her marriage and wishes she had continued working after raising her children because she liked her job.  The women compare their children to the generation of children at the time of the interview, remarking that children have become more spoiled but also more intelligent.  Many of them note that they knew nothing about sex or pregnancy until they married because their parents felt that children should not be exposed to such knowledge.  In contrast, they observe how the generation of children at the time of the interview know more about these topics than they did at the same age.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStella Loregio speaks predominantly in Italian, with an unidentified man acting as a translator at the very end of her narrative.

Sherman begins by describing his childhood in Kolomea, noting that his father immigrated to Canada in 1913 and from there to the US in 1914.  He explains that the prolonged absence of his father strengthened the relationship he had with his mother, a well-educated woman who inculcated in him the desire to get an education, and the impact of her death when he was 16 years old.  He recalls that Kolomea was on the border between Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire and, as a result, the town was often in the middle of border disputes.  He explains that his father sent for the family at the end of World War I, but they were unable to immigrate to the United States until 1921.  He discusses organizations that aided immigrants upon arrival in the United States, particularly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and living conditions on the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.

He recalls meeting his wife at a holiday party; their wedding in 1936; and their moves to the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn and the Bayside neighborhood of Queens.

He emphasizes his involvement in politics, noting his involvement in the Robert F. Wagner Club; his support of various political candidates during the last 10 to 15 years; and his desire for the the young generation at the time of the interview to develop political acumen and a desire to participate in politics.

He immigrated to the US in 1920 and settled at 159 East Houston Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  He was a mattress worker and a member and organizer of the Furniture Workers Industrial Union and the United Furniture Workers of America.

This interview covers Alex Sirota's working life, his union activity, and his early life in Romania.  Sirota discusses his membership and work as an organizer in an unspecified furniture workers' union and the affiliation of that union with the Furniture Workers Industrial Union in 1936.  He describes the creation of the United Furniture Workers of America (UFWA) in 1937 and the affiliation of his local with them.  He describes his work to unionize the factory at which he worked for the UFWA; a 26 week strike that followed the unionization of that factory; and he and his daughter being threatened by representatives of his employer.  He describes the ethnic and racial demographics of the original membership of the UFWA (predominantly Jewish) and the membership at the time of the interview (predominantly black and Puerto Rican).  He recounts meetings of the general membership being conducted and recorded in Yiddish, with the minority learning Yiddish in order to participate.  He discusses cultivating certain workers to be union officers; officers continuing to work in the shops as an officer's salary was not enough to live on; and this leading to officers having a better understanding of the needs of the general membership.  He discusses the union leadership at the time of the interview being paid a substantial salary and not having to continue working in the factories, which he felt led to a separation of the leadership from the general membership and inferior management of the union.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSirota discusses his early life in Romania, including his memories of the Russian Revolution; anti-Semitism in Romania; and his decision to emigrate.  He describes the importance of union officials' dedication to the union over their own personal interests; of the union possessing both organizational and political power; and of the general decline in union membership at the time of the interview.  Other topics include a trip he took through France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviet Union in 1951; his two appearances before the House Un-American Activities Committee; the role of the Communist Party of the United States of America in the labor movement; a trip he took to Israel in 1966; his parents' immigration and acclimation to the US; the dangers associated with being a member of the union; his interest in a Jewish paper and Jewish literature; his wife's occupation as a garment worker and member of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union; and his opinions of the youth movements occurring at the time of the interview.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eFurniture workers -- Labor unions\u003c/subject\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eJews, Romanian -- United States -- Interviews\u003c/subject\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eUnited Furniture Workers of America\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref187\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eSmith, Mozelle\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344195\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344195\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1974/1974\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1974 May 2\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_3033828dc594c2875aba32ca6827e93c\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_3033828dc594c2875aba32ca6827e93c\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e195, 195a\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_819dc2d578e6ba05b7f0dbcdeac0c1c7\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874964]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e56\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_819dc2d578e6ba05b7f0dbcdeac0c1c7\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e187a - 187c\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/4qrfjdw5\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Smith, Mozelle\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmith, Mozelle: 1974 May 2\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_d0fee5c4eed34e5ea6d180d3cd85a5e1\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eMozelle Smith was born Marcella Gale at 504 West 125th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.

This interview covers Smith's childhood in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York; her education; her work in domestic service; part of her mother's life in Chesterfield County, Virginia; a discussion between herself and Gigi about religion; and Smith's musings on how New York City and its inhabitants have changed since her childhood.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmith begins the interview by recounting how she received her nickname, Mozelle, in school and how the name has stayed with her.  She describes growing up in Harlem and specifically focuses on living in racially mixed areas, both on 125th Street and 127th Street.  She explains the impact this had on her education experience, noting that the first school she attended, Public School (PS) 43, was a predominantly white school, where the teachers treated her well, but she often fought with other students when they called her racial slurs.  She recalls that when she transferred to PS 157, she expected to be treated fairly because there were more black students, but they ostracized her because she lived in a white neighborhood, which prompted fights with them.  Smith recounts her mother not understanding her aggressive reaction to racial slurs and attributes this to her being accustomed to such treatment due to growing up in Virginia.  She recounts her mother's time in Virginia and her experience migrating to New York; her mother's job as a chambermaid near Columbia University in Manhattan; the difference in the ways in which lighter and darker skinned black people were treated; and her experience at church and Sunday school.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmith and Gigi have a long discussion concerning religion, covering topics such as the difference in the way the black community and others practice religion; whether such a delineation should exist; changes in the importance of religion for both groups; and the impact of slavery and African traditions on the development of black spirituality.  Other topics include Smith's musings on changes in New York City since her childhood; Spanish becoming as important a language as English in the United States at the time of the interview; her reasons for never having children; and comparing the connotations of being referred to as black or negro.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref188\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eStackhouse, Ollie\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344196\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344196\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 November 11 and December 1\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_7ddb46b2ba16fa994fa551e60b6d2059\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_7ddb46b2ba16fa994fa551e60b6d2059\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e199, 199a-d\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_f77015f2da393b95559d11ede1c9d572\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874972]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e57\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_f77015f2da393b95559d11ede1c9d572\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e188a - 188e\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_e762fbe805ddc50266b563e86311e8a9\" label=\"Master reel [31142054874980]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e58\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_e762fbe805ddc50266b563e86311e8a9\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e188f - 188i\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/12jm6b2w\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Stackhouse, Ollie\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eStackhouse, Ollie: 1975 November 11 and December 1\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_482eacce8aca2376b53a4f0f859f4bb4\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eOllie Stackhouse was born in Rippon, West Virginia in 1912.

This interview covers Stackhouse's childhood in Rippon, West Virginia; her migrations to Maryland, New Jersey, and New York; and her work as a domestic employee, cook, and factory worker.  Stackhouse begins by describing her childhood in Rippon, West Virginia, noting that she had a tight-knit, self-sufficient family.  She explains that the black community accounted for half of the population in Rippon and notes that race relations were relatively cordial despite segregation in the town.  She discusses the history of parts of her family; descriptions of where each of her sisters settled; her family's domestic work for and relationship with the Long family in Rippon; and religious and secular holidays and traditions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStackhouse explains that her desire to leave Rippon came from listening to stories many of her sisters and neighbors related about living in various cities, including New York, New York.  She describes moving to Baltimore, Maryland and living with her sisters on Madison Avenue near Druid Hill Park.  She recalls different families for whom she worked; her cleaning responsibilities; her ability to create her own schedule; and leaving one employer because of her racist attitude.  She discusses working in a department store, a job she found better than domestic work because of its health benefits and worker's compensation.  She discusses the stigma associated with domestic work; her and her family's living and working conditions during the Great Depression; dating practices in Baltimore during the 1930s and 40s; the way in which she met and married her husband; and the limited job opportunities available to the black population in the 1940s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStackhouse explains that she moved to New Jersey after her husband was discharged from the Army after World War II and that she acquired domestic work with a family who brought her to New York, New York in 1945.  She describes other industries in which she worked, including as a cook at the Rainbow Room at 30 Rockefeller Center in Manhattan; a packer in a garment factory; and as a saleswoman in Macy's.  She notes that she enjoyed these jobs more than domestic work because they had less restrictions and allowed her to meet a wide variety of people.  She recalls having to adjust her work schedule after her son was born in 1952, giving up her job at Macy's to take care of him when she was unable find a reputable babysitter.  Other topics include her husband's employment as a presser in the garment industry and his work for Con Edison; the ways in which women raised families and navigated discriminatory practices at work; a comparison of life in a city and in the country; a comparison of life in the southern and northern United States (US); the typical sequence of a family's migration from the southern to the northern US; and her frequent visits to her remaining family in West Virginia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref189\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eStanley, Mary Belle: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344197\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344197\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_68508f12f5d795948af0c81532fd24b3\" label=\"Audio\" type=\"Box\"\u003eMissing\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_e2fe7dfd357cff47ad38c740e877d1d6\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eMary Belle Stanley was born Hyde County, North Carolina.

The interview covers Yetta Stein's early life in Vienna, Austria-Hungary; her immigration to the United States (US); her marriage; her working life; and her union activity.  Stein recounts the rape and pillage by Russian troops in Nadvirna in the Polish region of Austria-Hungary during World War I and the fact that this led her family to flee to Vienna.  She describes her life in Vienna as happy but constrained by latent anti-Semitism; the fact that she had many friends who were not Jewish; and her surprise at their overt anti-Semitism once Germany annexed Austria in 1938.  She recounts that some of her Jewish friends and family became Austrian citizens, but that she and her husband could not afford to do so, and that this saved their lives as the Nazis had no authority over Polish citizens at that time.  She recounts deciding to immigrate to the US in 1938 with her daughter; her husband staying in Vienna as he had no family in the US to sponsor his immigration; and the year her husband spent alone in Vienna destroying his mental health.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStein describes a happy life in the US and attributes it to the freedom accorded to all Americans.  She explains that she was advised by the National Council of Jewish Women to move to St. Louis, Missouri so that she and her husband could learn trades without having to be members of a union.  She describes their apartment in St. Louis and how happy she was there.  She recalls that she and her husband both joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) in St. Louis.  She recalls that the ILGWU helped her find work in a factory in New York City, where she worked for the next 22 years.  She describes how much she enjoyed working in the factory; that she liked both the work and her co-workers; and that she made many friends there, both Jewish and West Indian.  She describes how important working outside the home was for the women at the factory and the pride they took in their work.  She explains the different jobs in the factory; how they were divided between men and women; and the different pay schedules across these jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eWorld War, 1914-1918 |z Poland |v Personal narratives.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref841\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eStein, Yetta: Transcript and Index\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593182\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593182\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1973 March 25\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_dc8e808bfd1b721e51491d5dcfa35d50\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_dc8e808bfd1b721e51491d5dcfa35d50\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e80\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref192\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eSunderman, [Unknown]: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344200\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344200\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1973 April 24\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_6c708dbb44df423462599c0a7ebb0086\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_6c708dbb44df423462599c0a7ebb0086\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e39\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_02c0dfcd7d83856e021d5acbcca60f08\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875003]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e60\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_02c0dfcd7d83856e021d5acbcca60f08\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e192a - 192b\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/msbcc8qc\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Sunderman, [Unknown]: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eSunderman, [Unknown]: Audio Recording: 1973 April 24\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_fa35122be924f53cbcdd36045f90387c\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eMrs. Sunderman was born in Frankfurt, Germany in the late 19th century.

Torres was placed in various orphanages managed by the Archdiocese of New York including in Kingsbridge, Tarrytown, and Mount Loretto in Staten Island.  He attended school in these orphanages through ninth grade, left the orphanage when he was 17 years old, and moved to the Eastern Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan.

This interview covers Tony Torres' migration from Puerto Rico to New York, New York, and his work in haberdasheries and a bakery.  Torres mentions that he, his mother, and his brother migrated to the New York, New York in 1918 in search of better economic opportunities.  He describes being sent to a series of orphanages after his mother died during the influenza epidemic in 1918.  He notes that while he did learn English in the orphanages, he also lost his native Spanish while living there and mentions that the orphans tended to stick together regardless of their nationality.  Torres explains that he worked various odd jobs until he found stable work in a haberdashery, emphasizing how specific trades were usually associated with specific social networks or ethnic groups.  He describes getting a job at a bakery through the newspaper; joining an unspecified bakers' union (likely the Journeymen Bakers Union of New York); being elected shop steward; and enduring a seven month strike for better wages and work hours.  He notes that, at the time of the strike, the union was composed of mostly independent locals that kept to themselves whereas, at the time of interview, the locals presented a more united front within the industry.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTorres explains that Puerto Ricans who migrated to New York remained mostly in tight-knit groups; migrants emphasized the importance of tradition, especially the retention of the Spanish language; and that their children integrated with other ethnic groups, diluting some of the strong Puerto Rican traditions.  He notes the lack of organization and leadership in the Puerto Rican population, which he believes contributed to their lack of a political presence, particularly in New York City.  Other topics include the relationships between different immigrant populations where he lived and worked; New York City politics, predominantly focusing on Fiorello La Guardia and Vito Marcantonio; the surge in Puerto Rican migration to the United States in the 1940s; Puerto Rican involvement in politics; the development of labor unions, with emphasis on the inclusion of immigrant and minority groups; the mechanization of bakery work and its impact on bakers; his leisure time activities; and a comparison between the importance of religion to his generation of Puerto Ricans and younger generations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee also:  Ethnicity; Family; Leisure; Politics; and Unionization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003ePuerto Ricans |x Cultural assimilation |z New York (State) |z New York.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref197\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eTossio, Primo: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344205\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344205\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 April 8\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_dec4ee076f30bce2a6549de31eb4fc08\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_dec4ee076f30bce2a6549de31eb4fc08\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e164\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Card Box - 6.5 - long\" id=\"aspace_53e79396eaaa0416209fe5c1685b52c8\" label=\"Access cd [31142054875417]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e101\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_b82800f5e7cf232c1b6dcc8413f694b0\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875029]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e62\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_b82800f5e7cf232c1b6dcc8413f694b0\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e197a - 197b\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/02v6x3vv\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Tossio, Primo: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eTossio, Primo: Audio Recording: 1975 April 8\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_418ae63728e8ce5ecf52811eed02da7e\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrimo Tossio was born in Rome, Italy and was the oldest of eight children.

This interview covers Margareta Unger's childhood in Austria; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1920; and her life and work in the US up to the time of the interview.  Unger begins by describing her childhood in Austria; her father's remarriage after her mother's death; his death, which left Unger with her stepmother, who was soon unable to care for her; and her movement among a series of relatives, one of whom physically abused her.  She describes returning to Vienna to attend high school; meeting her husband in a coffeehouse; and emphasizing her stepmother's disapproval in the difference in their ages.  She recalls renouncing her religion for her husband and enduring a protracted court battle to sever her stepmother's guardianship over her.  She explains that her husband's wealth was seized by the state as funds for World War I (WWI); her poverty during WWI; her immigration to Russia in 1917 after her husband was drafted into the Austrian Army and stationed there; and their illegal immigration back to Austria in order to avoid the Russian Revolution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnger explains that many of her husband's siblings already lived in the US and that one brother returned to Austria to bring them back to the US.

She notes that she was able to acclimate more easily to the US than her husband; quickly finding work as a domestic worker; renting a hotel in New Hampshire during one summer so that she could set up her own Viennese restaurant; struggling to find consistent employment; and teaching her husband English so he could become a chauffeur.  She recalls visiting her brothers-in-law in Brodhead, Wisconsin and Rockford, Illinois in 1934 and 1935 and her husband encouraging her to help them grow their business.  Unger discusses opening another restaurant on 280 Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan, where she worked as the chef and manager while her husband worked the cash register and washed the dishes.  She recalls food shortages during World War II forcing them to close; finding work as a pattern-maker and later department head at McCall's; working with the pantograph machine; and disguising patterns sent to England so the company could avoid taxes.

The narrator and location of this interview are unknown.  The narrator of this interview does not provide any information about himself.  This interview covers the reasons for black migration within the United States (US); the history of black sociopolitical movements; and the living and social conditions of black populations in northern cities in the US.  The narrator describes reasons black families would migrate from the southern US to the north, including a boll weevil infestation that severely damaged the cotton crop during the 1920s; the repression of minorities in the south; better education opportunities in the north; positive accounts from relatives; the economic opportunities created by the decreased immigration from Europe during World War I; and the idealistic mythology surrounding the north.  He recounts the ways in which racial segregation in the south gave rise to a black middle class that worked toward fulfilling the needs of the black community.  He elaborates on different sociopolitical movements that occurred between the Civil War and the time of the interview, noting that each of these developments assigned importance to different aspects of black life. He discusses Garveyism, the Tuskegee movement, the Niagara movement, and the development of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  Topics relating to these movements include the liberation of black people; the immigrationist movements; the development of the foundation of a strong black economy; and the legal struggles for social and political equality.  The narrator focuses on the logistics of the typical migration, including how a single family member, usually a young man, would establish the living and financial situation before the rest of the family moved.  He explains that black families typically settled in what he referred to as the black belts of the city, crowded areas with poor living conditions that were eventually alleviated by public housing projects.  Other topics include the exclusionary tendencies of labor unions, which led to black employees developing their own unions, especially for unskilled labor; the differences between the older and younger generations' forms of leisure and entertainment, and the differences between white and black families with the extended family playing a much larger role in black families.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee also:  Interview Compilation for Radio Broadcast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref355\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eUnidentified Italian-American woman\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"592028\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e592028\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1973/1973\"\u003e1973\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_13dfc774c8f074dd330f7510a01f5f9a\" label=\"Master reel\" type=\"Box\"\u003eNo Master\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/b5mkm3qp\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Unidentified Italian-American woman\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnidentified Italian-American woman: 1973-\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_86965dc9fde5c19aaf2eddb59827eac6\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe narrator is not identified by name.

He notes that he had no desire to become an American citizen until his son became upset about admitting at school that his father was not a citizen, and that doing so ostracized him from some of his Socialist friends.  He describes becoming a member of both the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 89 and the Industrial Workers of the World, detailing the growth of the ILGWU despite tension between the Socialists and Communists within the union.  Throughout his interview, Uttaro emphasizes the practicality of compromise, noting that even though he was an active member of the union and a Socialist, he tended to criticize his affiliates when he believed they were pursuing their ideals to extremes.  He discusses taking part in a program through the union in which he visited older union members who lived alone after he retired at age 65.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eSocialists |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003ccorpname rules=\"dacs\" source=\"naf\"\u003eIndustrial Workers of the World\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eInternational Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.

This interview covers Walters' childhood in Saint Kitts; her immigration to the US;, her marriages and children; and her working life, predominantly as a nurse in Jersey City, New Jersey; Fort Benning, Georgia; and Brooklyn.  Walters begins by briefly describing her childhood in Saint Kitts, noting that she lived with her grandparents, aunt, uncle, and sister; and that her grandfather owned his own land.  She discusses her immigration to the US in 1917, including making herself appear older in order to board the ship; enduring the eight day voyage alone; and being unable to eat much.  Walters describes settling in Jersey City with her mother and stepfather, who were the superintendents of a 60 family apartment building, and how she started working rather than continuing her education.  She explains that she got her first job working as a telephone operator in her apartment building and was later hired as a nurse for the children of the Lerner family in Jersey City.  Walters explains that the Lerners and their staff treated her like family, and that the chauffeur and chef took a particular interest in her.  She recounts meeting and marrying a chauffeur from Virginia in 1922, noting that she separated from him when he lost his job during the Great Depression and had no inclination to find another one.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalters discusses her and her children's move to New York, where she worked various jobs before marrying her second husband, who served in the Army, during World War II; traveling back and forth between the US and Germany with him between 1951 and 1956; and adopting another child in Germany.  She describes taking a course in nursing while she lived in Fort Benning from 1956 to 1962; working night shifts as a baby nurse at the Brooklyn Community Hospital for 11 years when the family moved back to New York; and augmenting the household income when her husband retired from the Army.  She recalls joining an unspecified union while at the hospital (likely Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union) but notes that her hospital did not go on strike because the administration acquiesced to their demands once they saw what was happening in other hospitals in the area.  She describes her duties as a baby nurse and emphasizes the friendly relationship among the staff members in the hospital.  Other topics include the lives and occupations of her children; her living conditions during the Great Depression; and racial discrimination in Georgia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eLocal 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union (New York, N.Y.)\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref993\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eWalters, [Unknown Man]\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593522\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593522\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate\u003eUndated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_8e84a6425824ff85da81e2aa66924b45\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_8e84a6425824ff85da81e2aa66924b45\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e216a\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_e8bf8b1030b7b090986a12514c35aabf\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875391]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e99\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_e8bf8b1030b7b090986a12514c35aabf\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e993a\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_f7bc2aa60038443adef085c7fa9b2409\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875169]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e76\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_f7bc2aa60038443adef085c7fa9b2409\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e993b\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/hhmgqvtx\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Walters, [Unknown Man]\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalters, [Unknown Man]: Undated\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_612f116458644400b09821c786bb747c\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Walters was born in Jamaica in 1895.

The first name of the narrator is unknown.  This interview covers Mr. Walters' childhood in Jamaica; his immigration to the United States (US) when he was 19 years old; and his life and work in the construction industry in New York, New York.  Walters begins by describing the reason his family immigrated to the US, noting that his family moved primarily due to economic conditions.  He explains that many of his relatives had already immigrated to the US and some of his immediate family and distant relatives followed his family after their immigration.  He notes that the family made sure to help any new members adjust to life in the US.  He recalls attending an unspecified vocational school at which he learned carpentry, and working in the construction industry as a carpenter and mechanic.  He recalls working on the George Washington Bridge, Madison Square Garden, The Daily News Building, the subway in Queens, and schools near the City College of New York.  He joined an unspecified construction workers' union in New York City, which he remembers specifically for its assistance in reducing working hours.  Walters lived in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan and noticed that, while he felt safe in his neighborhood, there was a divide between the white and black populations.  He emphasizes the role of the sanitation workers in New York City, explaining that he believes that they are more important than the police because they keep the city clean.  He notes that while gangsters have consistently been a problem in New York City, narcotics have made the generation coming of age at the time of the interview more violent and destructive than their predecessors.

She recounts a strike in 1932 and 1933 led by the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) in which she convinced her co-workers to participate; one factory where workers had not joined the strike and her decision to disconnect the factory's electricity; and the benefits the ILGWU gained for them after the strike.  She discusses her work as the chairlady in the factory, in particular convincing management that the work involved more than sewing and that workers' examination of the garments and adaption to new styles should be included in their salary.

The interview covers Jean Weiner's childhood in Bessarabia, Russia; her family's life after their immigration to the United States (US); her working life; and her union activity.  Weiner describes the daily life of her family in Bessarabia in great detail, including specifics on her father's tailoring business; the food her mother would prepare for the family; how her mother made extra money while her father was in the US; and the importance her father placed on education.  She describes the different types of apartments the family rented as they moved into better apartments in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York before being able to afford a private house on Vermont Street in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn.  She recounts that the family had boarders; that her many relatives would frequently visit; how she enjoyed having so many people in the house; and that family and friends would help each other in times of need or illness.  She compares the way the family lived in Russia to their life in the US, describing the variety of meat that was available in the US; the way the family shopped for food and goods, mainly from pushcarts on Rivington Street in the Lower East Side; and the different status levels amongst the working class in both countries, which were determined by a person's profession.  She recounts her working life, which began soon after she arrived in the US; how much money she was expected to contribute to the household; the division of labor between men and women; and the fact that there were certain jobs that only men could do.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Weiner does not specify to which union she belonged (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union), she describes her union activity in great detail.

She describes in great detail the chairwoman of her local, whom she describes as well-educated, radical, and a Socialist.  She discusses deciding to take a vacation from work as she had enough money to do so and spending the summer with her mother and siblings in Huntington, Connecticut; she and her sister flirting with young men in front of a country store near their camp; and meeting her husband through one of these men.  Other topics include the family's more secular life in the US; the Jewish street gang, The Little Augies; life in Jewish neighborhoods in New York City; and pride in her ability to work so that her youngest brother and sister were able to graduate high school and attend college.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eWomen labor union members -- New York (State) -- New York\u003c/subject\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref847\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eWeiner, Jean: Transcript; Summary; and Index\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"593188\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e593188\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1975/1975\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1975 March 2, March 28, and April 11\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_44f1a3cc0dbed89f7d7a1a3182373361\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142054861714]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_44f1a3cc0dbed89f7d7a1a3182373361\" type=\"Folder\"\u003e90\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref213\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eWeinstein, Helen Taub: Audio Recording\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitid audience=\"internal\" identifier=\"344221\" type=\"Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT\"\u003e344221\u003c/unitid\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1974/1974\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1974 May 1\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_c6eda56c52790e29023290841ee04417\" label=\"Access cassette\" type=\"Box\"\u003eAccess Cassettes\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_c6eda56c52790e29023290841ee04417\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e65\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_9bae58606a60b10048e7b2dc2de4e7f3\" label=\"Master reel [31142054875110]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e71\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer parent=\"aspace_9bae58606a60b10048e7b2dc2de4e7f3\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e213a - 213b\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cdao ns2:actuate=\"onRequest\" ns2:href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/1vhhmpvn\" ns2:role=\"Audio-Service\" ns2:show=\"new\" ns2:title=\"Weinstein, Helen Taub: Audio Recording\" ns2:type=\"simple\"\u003e\u003cdaodesc\u003e\u003cp\u003eWeinstein, Helen Taub: Audio Recording: 1974 May 1\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/daodesc\u003e\u003c/dao\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_0a20b532508d0794d611dfdeb32dfe72\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eBiographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eHelen Taub Weinstein was born on July 26, 1897 in Russia.

This interview covers Ellen Williams' childhood in Darliston, Jamaica; her immigration to the United States (US); and her life and work as a baby nurse and a nurses' aide in New York, New York.  Williams begins by describing her childhood in Jamaica, specifically recalling her father's occupation as a coachman in Kingston; the perception of this job as prestigious due to the wages and uniforms; and his occupation later as a pimento and coffee farmer in Darliston.  She recalls that despite the racial segregation in the schools and churches, children were generally friendly with one another.  She describes working as a baby nurse for a family in Jamaica, noting that they treated her like family; deferred to her on matters regarding their children; and introduced her to politicians and other friends of theirs.  She discusses the differences between life in the city and in the country; the different roles of men and women in both the household and society; the finances of her household; Catholic traditions, including holiday services and the role of godparents; and other secular traditions, particularly birthdays and festivals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliams explains that she immigrated to the US at the behest of her cousin and recalls the sponsorship and monetary requirements for her immigration in June 1947.  Her initial impression of New York City was that it was filled with trees and well-dressed people.  She explains that while her cousins helped her to acclimate to life in New York, she had difficulty adapting to the winter weather.  She describes working as a baby nurse for various families in New York City, recalling that after her marriage in 1948, she only took jobs that did not require her to live with her employers.  She describes her work and training as a nurse's aide at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Williams recalls joining Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union in 1963 or 1964 and notes that despite her initial skepticism of its benefits, the union gave hospital workers greater job security and wage increases.  Other topics include the differences between her work as a baby nurse and nurse's aide; her siblings' education, careers, and families; her husband's occupation and family; her interactions with and impressions of union leaders, particularly Doris Turner and Leon Davis; her involvement in the West Indian and American Friendly Society and St. John's Lodge; and her visits to Jamaica to see her family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003ccontrolaccess\u003e\u003csubject source=\"lcsh\"\u003eJamaicans |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.\u003c/subject\u003e\u003ccorpname source=\"naf\"\u003eLocal 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union (New York, N.Y.)\u003c/corpname\u003e\u003c/controlaccess\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003c/c\u003e"
