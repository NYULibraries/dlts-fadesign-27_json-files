He was a union organizer for the International Seamen's Union of America at the age of twenty-five, and as the rank and file broke away to form the National Maritime Union, so did he. Shortly thereafter, he volunteered for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, serving in Spain. In World War Two, he served as a merchant seaman, most notably on the Murmansk Run. This collection contains photos and negatives, some from the Spanish Civil War, most of 1980s commemorative events."
