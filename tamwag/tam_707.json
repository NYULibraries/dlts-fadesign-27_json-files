He was among the founding members of several other communist organizations including the Revolutionary Union, the Revolutionary Communist Party, and the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters. He was involved in organizational activities in Minnesota, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, Newark, and New York City.
