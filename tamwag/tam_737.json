He was raised in New York City, and was involved in organized labor and leftist activism from an early age. In high school Bookchin studied science and mathematics heavily, but later shifted his intellectual interests to political theory.  Although he received some formal education, his education was largely informal and self-directed. He was the author of two dozen books on politics, philosophy, history, and urban affairs as well as ecology. He is most well-known for his theories on ecology and his role in founding the social ecology movement. Bookchin's political ideology shifted many times throughout his life from Marxism, to anarchism, and later to a form of libertarian socialism he called libertarian confederalism."
