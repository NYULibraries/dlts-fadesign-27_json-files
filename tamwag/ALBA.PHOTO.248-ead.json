During the Spanish Civil War, Gandall worked mostly with Spanish troops, rather than the Lincoln Brigade. After the war, he continued his activism, including campaigning against American support for the Contras. He suffered a heart attack during a confrontation with police over the Persian Gulf War and died shortly thereafter."
