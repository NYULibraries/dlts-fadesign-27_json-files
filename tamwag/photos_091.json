In the 1950s and 1960s, he became involved in the movements for nuclear disarmament and against the war in Vietnam. In addition to his literary works, Cameron published books on Marxism and Stalinism, and his literary work was informed by his political worldview. His prize-winning biography, The Young Shelley: Genesis of a Radical (1950) took Shelley's social message seriously, as did his other works on Shelley."
