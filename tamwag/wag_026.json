By the end of the year, the organization had more than 1000 dues-paying members and was actively organizing around the country.  The Union convened annual delegates' assemblies, offered a low-cost health and dental insurance plan for freelancers, instituted a committee structure, and produced materials to assist their membership such as a model book contract, a survey of New England publications and a checklist of questions for writers to use when bidding on jobs.  Most significantly, the Union began to win contracts with periodicals, such as \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eMother Jones\u003c/emph\u003e, \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eColumbia Journalism Review\u003c/emph\u003e, \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eIn These Times\u003c/emph\u003e, and \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eLos Angeles Weekly\u003c/emph\u003e.
