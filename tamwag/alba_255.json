He served at Cordoba and Brunete, and was wounded in action on July 23, 1937.  He returned to the United States after July of 1938. Yellin was born in Connecticut; he was an architect and a draftsman.  He also served in the United States Navy during World War II (from April 1944-December 1945), as radar mechanic."
