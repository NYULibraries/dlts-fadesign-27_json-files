In France, Rosenblum visited the USC rest home at St. Goin (Aquitane); the Walter B. Cannon Memorial Hospital and recreation center in\nToulouse; the Camp Clairac (Lot-et-Garonne) for underprivileged French and Spanish children; the Meillon Rest Home in Pau, which housed Spanish Nazi victims; and a summer camp and canteen in Les Andelys (Normandie). Starting in October, his photos began appearing regularly in the Unitarians' monthly magazine, the \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eChristian Register\u003c/emph\u003e. Rosenblum had been a U.S. Army Signal Corp combat photographer, and took the first motion picture footage of the Dachau concentration camp. Born in 1919 into a poor Jewish immigrant family living on New York's Lower East Side, in 1937 he joined the Film and Photo League, a Communist-associated popular front organization."
