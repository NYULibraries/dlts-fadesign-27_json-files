American Business Consultants, Inc. was founded in 1947 and was a major force in McCarthy-era investigations into suspected Communist activity. Their for-profit weekly publication \u003ctitle render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack\u003c/title\u003e and special report \u003ctitle render=\"italic\"\u003eRed Channels\u003c/title\u003e provided readers with specific names and information on allegedly subversive individuals and organizations. As a result of the financial difficulties caused by ensuing libel suits, ABC transferred their research files to the Church League. Additional files came from the Wackenhut Corporation, which was founded in 1954 by George R. Wackenhut and other former FBI employees. The company, which provided private security to industry and government agencies, also kept extensive files on individuals, ostensibly to run background checks. The Wackenhut Corporation received many research files from Karl Baarslag who worked for such prominent anti-communists as Senator Joseph McCarthy, Church League of America, and the American Legion. Following the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Wackenhut Corporation transferred many of its research files to the Church League.\u003clb/\u003e\u003clb/\u003e\n\nThe research files contain newspaper and magazine clippings, reports, flyers, internal and external correspondence, pamphlets, brochures, circulars, and government publications. \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack\u003c/emph\u003e's 1940s-1950s research activities are especially focused on entertainment, unions, suspected Communist Party fronts, foundations and individuals in public life suspected of subversive activities. Many of the Wackenhut documents and a series on student movements in California highlight the suspected connections between Communism, opposition to the Vietnam War, and the broader left counterculture of the 1960s, and document the right's evolving definition of \"subversion.\" The meticulous and thorough collecting activities that led to the creation of these research files makes them a strong source of information on Communists and the left from the 1940s-1970s, and taken as a whole they illustrate the right's interpretation of the political and cultural environment of the mid-twentieth century United States."

(ABC) was founded in 1947 by former Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Theodore C. Kirkpatrick, John G. Keenan, and Kenneth M. Bierly. ABC was established as a source of information regarding allegedly subversive organizations and individuals, particularly those suspected of affiliation with the Communist Party USA. The organization was mainly funded by Alfred Kohlberg, a Jewish American businessman and fervent anti-communist who was a member of the John Birch Society and the China Lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn May 1947, ABC began publishing a for-profit weekly called \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack: The Newsletter of Facts on Communism\u003c/emph\u003e. The newsletter, headquartered in New York, sought to \"combat communism and those who aid its cause.\" At its peak, \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack\u003c/emph\u003e had a circulation of about 7,500, primarily in New York. Keenan served as \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack's \u003c/emph\u003e president and devoted much of his time to soliciting subscriptions from business executives and their corporations. Kirkpatrick took on the roles of managing editor and the publication's chief spokesman. Bierly was vice president and shouldered most of the responsibility for overseeing \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack's\u003c/emph\u003e extensive research department.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn June 1950, ABC published a special report called \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eRed Channels\u003c/emph\u003e, which listed 151 alleged subversive individuals in the film, radio, and television industries. \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eRed Channels\u003c/emph\u003e made the relationship between ABC and the federal government especially apparent, as the publication recorded the number of times an individual had been cited by the FBI, the House on Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and other government agencies. The publication gained notoriety as the \"Bible of Madison Avenue,\" as it was consulted by advertisers and network executives. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of the film and radio personalities listed in \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eRed Channels\u003c/emph\u003e charged ABC with libel suits. Though ABC successfully defended itself or settled out of court, the financial cost of the litigation and the questioning of ABC in the media, from both left and right-wing sources, were damaging to the organization. Of the original ABC founders, only Keenan remained with \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack\u003c/emph\u003e after the early 1950s. Bierly departed \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack\u003c/emph\u003e in 1951 and became a clearance consultant, working for clients like Columbia Pictures. Kirkpatrick, whose position as the newsletter's spokesman earned him the nickname \"Mr. Counterattack,\" left the publication in 1952 in hopes of running for political office. The newsletter continued to be distributed in the aftermath of the \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eRed Channels\u003c/emph\u003e frenzy, but it was understaffed and in financial straits. By the mid-1960s, \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack's\u003c/emph\u003e circulation had shrunk considerably, and in 1973 publication ceased entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/bioghist\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref334\" level=\"subseries\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eSubseries I: Countries\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1938/1958\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1938-1958\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_e7ee7e377460c1876b5b7f3f30d76c14\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Content Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis subseries consists primarily of clippings on international political, social and diplomatic developments in the aftermath of World War II, with an emphasis on Communist movements and governments.

were collected in the 1940s. Much of the activity of the Communist Party took place in the context of working within mass organizations; those established by the Party were often referred to as front organizations. Mass organizations were usually devoted to a single issue or constituency and had a broader membership and political appeal than that of the official Party line. Some organizations within this series were known fronts, others were suspected fronts by ABC.  The materials in this subseries afford a perspective of both anti-Communist efforts to expose front organizations as well as the leftist political agenda of these alleged fronts in terms of postwar domestic and foreign policy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e These organizations are mostly left organizations, including peace movements, political action and labor committees, progressive and civil rights groups, student organizations, schools and universities, and anti-fascist groups, including the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and other Spanish solidarity groups. The series also features multiple Communist country solidarity groups, including the National Council for American-Soviet Friendship. Documentation within each file is essentially an accumulation of information relating to certain suspected front organizations. Materials in the collection generally consist of newspaper clippings relating to the front's activities; pamphlets and other materials published by the front organization; leaflets, programs, and announcements of front rallies, meetings, and functions; and membership lists of fronts, including names and addresses. \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack \u003c/emph\u003e gathered any information they could to build a case and prove that they were Communist affiliated.

The majority of the materials come from between 1946 and 1949, and reflect attacks on Communism in unions and the attempts of union leaders to defend themselves, as well as simple documentation of union actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack\u003c/emph\u003e acquired any information they could to build a case against a trade union and accuse them of having Communist sympathies in their publication or in their reports. They acquired information often through the use of mailing lists or through an informant. Files contain clippings, circulars, flyers, pamphlets, meeting minutes, membership lists, convention proceedings, and other material created by unions. The series also contains reports and internal correspondence created by \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack\u003c/emph\u003e informants within the unions and the \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eCounterattack\u003c/emph\u003e research department. Most files are on American trade unions, many affiliated with the CIO and the AFL. Industries represented by the unions include manufacturing, entertainment, electrical, machine, retail, marine, textile, and service industries. This series also contains files on the Taft-Hartley Bill. There is a fair amount of material on union in-fighting over Communist sympathy. National unions are more widely represented.

They are a mixture of research files, correspondence, and administrative files for Wackenhut's library. Wackenhut's fastidious documentation of the activities of individuals and organizations make these files a strong source for information on players in Communist and left-wing politics in the 1950s-1970s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe research files are a mixture of clippings, essays, pamphlets, and other materials organized and frequently marked up by Wackenhut. Many of the research files were originally collected by former Joseph McCarthy aide Karl Baarslag and sold or gifted to Wackenhut. While the corporation's primary concern was monitoring the activities of Communist and left-leaning individuals and organizations, they collected materials from anyone engaged in the civic dialogue, including right-wing fringe groups. Taken as a whole, the files give insight into the range of activities that these right-wing anti-communists viewed as potential threats to stability in American society. The first 27 folders of the series, Subversive Activities, contain materials similar to the rest of the series, with a higher content of correspondence (much of it with Federal intelligence agencies), and research files on Vietnam War protests, espionage, and anti-communist efforts in Florida. These folders, and the series more broadly, point to the real and perceived connections between Communism, the anti-war movement, and the broader left counterculture of the 1960s, and document the right's evolving definition of \"subversion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterspersed with the research files are administrative files for the Wackenhut Corporation's library. Many of these files are correspondence with publications, mostly dating from 1966-1967. Most of the subscriptions were obtained using the aliases Carol Ascher and William Jones. Like the research files, the publications reflect the full spectrum of political viewpoints of the period and document the range of actors attempting to shape American society during this turbulent period. The publications themselves generally are not included in the files.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003cbioghist id=\"aspace_0df93d964d6ff8225005ee35447c5c3d\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eHistorical/Biographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Wackenhut Corporation was founded in 1954 by three former FBI men, including George R. Wackenhut. By the 1960s, the Coral Gables, Florida-based corporation was the third largest detective agency in the country. Wackenhut received numerous government contracts, both state and federal, and counted the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as two of its largest customers. By the 1980s much of their business was in administering prison security.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Wackenhut Corporation actively collected information on individuals, both to run background checks for their clients and as an outgrowth of George Wackenhut's anti-communist views. By 1971 the company had files on 2.5 million individuals. In response to the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the company reduced the number to between 225,000 and 250,000 files. In 1975 they gave many of their files to the Church League of America, which was not bound by the disclosure requirements of the law. As a part of its anti-communist security activities, Wackenhut also published a monthly newsletter called \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eThe Wackenhut Security

Many of the files appear to have been collected to write a manuscript on events at the University of California, Berkeley. A draft of this untitled 1967 manuscript is included. Also present are clippings, typed summaries of news articles, fliers, posters, typed notes on radio and television broadcasts, internal reports, and index cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe majority of the files document student activities at University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco State College. Subjects included in the files are student strikes, university building occupation, Vietnam War protests, sexual politics on campus, the Black Panthers and Black Power, the curriculum, Free Speech Movement, Students for a Democratic Society, and Community for New Politics. These files provide a right wing interpretation of student movements in the 1960s and also show the real or perceived links that the right wing tracked between the peace movement, student activism, the Communist Party USA, and other radical left wing groups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref2602\" level=\"file\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eJohn Birch
