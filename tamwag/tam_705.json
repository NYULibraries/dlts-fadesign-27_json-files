These materials include Freedom of Information Act request documents, copies of documents related to the Hiss trials, and correspondence bewteen Salant's attorney and the Department of Justice. The collection also contains drafts of Salant's writing about the Hiss trials and supporting research.

                "value": "Stephen Salant is an economist who taught at the University of Michigan from 1986 to 2015. He is most well-known for his research in the area of applied macroeconomics focusing on speculative attacks in the gold market. Salant has also maintained a continued interest in the 1949 trials of Alger Hiss and has performed independent research into evidence used during the trials. Through his research on Hiss, Salant has reexamined evidence related to the typewriter and Kodak film reels used as evidence during the trials. He argued that his research showed that the typewriter Whittaker Chambers claimed Hiss used to transcribe government documents was a forgery, and that the Kodak film reels known as the \"Pumpkin Papers\" were produced in the 1940s rather than the 1930s as Chambers claimed. In 1978 Salant sued the Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in an attempt to gain access to government records related to the trials. He has since published several articles related to his research."
