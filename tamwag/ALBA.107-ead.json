This material dates from the 1970s and 80s. There are also approximately 30 photos of veterans (1970s-80s, in the U.S. and Spain). Additional materials include correspondence and memorabilia documenting the personal and political life of Susman and his family; files related to book, film, curriculum and research projects on the Spanish Civil War, many sent to Susman for his comment or input; files of material and correspondence related to Spanish politics over the years; and correspondence with representatives of Soviet and other national groups of veterans. Notable are transcriptions of some of Susman's World War II letters and a copy print of a photo of Einstein, Joliet-Curie and Barsky. The photo and the transcriptions are located in box 4."
