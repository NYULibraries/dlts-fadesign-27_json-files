He resigned from the BLF in 1892 to begin organizing the American Railway Union (ARU). He was arrested in 1894 for his activities in a strike against the Pullman Palace Car Company and sentenced to six months in prison. He became a socialist shortly after serving his first prison sentence and was instrumental in forming the Social Democratic Party. In 1918 he was sentenced to ten years in prison as a result of his activities against American involvement in World War I. He was pardoned by President Warren G. Harding in 1921. Debs ran for President of the United States on the Socialist Party ticket in 1900, 1904, 1908, 1912, and 1920."
