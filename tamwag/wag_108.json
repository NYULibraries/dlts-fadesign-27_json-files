                "value": "The National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund (NOW LDEF) is a non-profit organization which has been in the forefront of advocacy and litigation for women's rights for the past twenty-five years. The organization was established as the litigating arm of the women's rights community in 1970 by the original founders of the National Organization for Women. The Fund employs a staff of clerical and support workers, an occupational category traditionally filled by females. In 1983, a small group of the support workers formed an organizing committee to seek union representation. The group chose to be represented by the National Organization of Legal Service Workers, UAW Local 2320 (part of UAW District 65). The Legal Service Workers was then part of District 65 UAW; it has been an autonomous Local of the United Automobile Workers since the demise of District 65 in 1993. The union developed a reputation for representing the interests of white collar workers, and this led the Legal Service Workers to seek an affiliation agreement with District 65. In light of the NOW LDEF's position and history as a champion of equality for working women, as well as the fact that the bargaining unit was comprised of only six individuals, the Union was unprepared for the level of opposition and resistance they encountered from the employer. Instead of the \"walk-in\" that they expected, the Union was forced to pursue its goals through the mechanisms of the National Labor Relations Board. Ultimately, the Legal Service Workers were unsuccessful in obtaining a contract. This resolution stands in contrast to the experience of the telephone bankers employed by the New York City Chapter of the National Organization For Women, who are currently represented by UAW Local 2110."
