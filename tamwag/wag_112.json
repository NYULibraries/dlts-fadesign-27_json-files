Other items included are minutes of the strike council, beginning in December 1910, reports of League committees on organization, legislation, and other matters, monthly reports of the League's organizer, and occasional annual reports of one or more of the officers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe series has a few gaps; scheduled meetings were sometimes omitted and occasional minutes and secretary's reports appear to be missing. The minutes of the League's annual meeting, held in March and devoted to annual reports and to election officers for the comming year, do not appear in the files until 1920. The minutes and reports reconstruct much of its day-to-day activity: its attempts to make contact with working women, its organizing efforts in various trades, its relations with local trade unions and the labor movement generally, and its legislative work. The executive board minutes are useful for recording changes in the League's ideology and priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/scopecontent\u003e\u003c/c\u003e\u003cc id=\"aspace_ref5\" level=\"series\"\u003e\u003cdid\u003e\u003cunittitle\u003eSeries II: Correspondence\u003c/unittitle\u003e\u003cunitdate normal=\"1908/1955\" type=\"inclusive\"\u003e1908-1955, undated\u003c/unitdate\u003e\u003ccontainer id=\"aspace_86ef4fe58d7793f1ec6a23ebbcf1fd9d\" label=\"Microform\" type=\"Reel\"\u003e6-16\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_f10355164be6d3f3db43f198147301c7\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142063413473]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e6\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_d020193a3f578a5dfe6882ab9442abd3\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142063413481]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e2\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_91a000d567600a9c1070497815881062\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142063413549]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e4\u003c/container\u003e\u003ccontainer altrender=\"Record carton\" id=\"aspace_3fbaa76a7ac20a2916c7e081445ac6f6\" label=\"Mixed Materials [31142063413515]\" type=\"Box\"\u003e5\u003c/container\u003e\u003c/did\u003e\u003cscopecontent id=\"aspace_25a6aff8d0fe78cfb738e086fa2b0290\"\u003e\u003chead\u003eScope and Content Note\u003c/head\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis series contains correspondence, the bulk of which comes from 1919-1926 and 1944-1955, with correspondence scattered throughout the rest of the organization's duration.
