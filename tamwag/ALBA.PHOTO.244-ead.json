Photographs are black and white prints ranging from 2 1/4\" square to 5\" x 7\". The scrapbook contains 23 pages, with photographs on both sides (= 64 pages of photographs); the rest of the pages are blank. Many of the photos are labeled and typed commentary on battles at Ebro, on the Aragon front and Teruel is also included within the scrapbook. This item is in extremely fragile condition thus researchers may use the preservation photocopy ONLY; they may handle the original only with permission from the Director."
