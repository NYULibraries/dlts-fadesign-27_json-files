Of particular interest to researchers is the network of friendships among labor and socialist activists revealed in these papers."

The first big event of this administration was the sponsorship of the Charles Zimmerman scholarship in 1981. This scholarship provided for two $250.00 cash awards - one for a student entering college and one for a student entering the labor force. In addition, an AFL-CIO educational program was launched to stress the significance of Samuel Gompers and the labor movement in U.S. history. Similar projects were promoted in New York City schools in honor of Meyer London, Benjamin Schlesinger, William Green, A. Philip Randolph, and George Meany. In 1998 the organization changed its name to Reunion for Tomorrow."

The correspondence of Marx Lewis, former secretary to Meyer London, to Charles Grossman, for example, documents Lewis' own political observations and activities, and those of the milieux from which he came, between 1963 and Grossman's death in 1979. The collection also contains thick files, mostly for individual years in the 1980s."
