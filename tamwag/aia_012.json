His interviews document many aspects of Irish American studies, immigrant experiences in America, his legal career, and his political experiences, including running for various offices, the development of the McBride Principles, and the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. The two interviews with Michael Flannery focus on his experiences in Ireland during the War for Independence and the Irish Civil War and his later life in the United States, including the founding of and resigning from Noraid. The interview with Charles J. Hynes concerns his childhood, family, and his involvement in Irish American affairs, beginning with the 1981 hunger strikes in Northern Ireland."

Although he discusses some of the issues also touched on in his book, such as educating African-Americans about voting in Mississippi during the 1960s, presiding over the New York City Council, and his participation in the 1968 Democratic National Convention, O'Dwyer also discusses his experiences both in Ireland and in America since writing the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eThe interviews contain much information relevant to Irish American studies, including insights into the history of Irish immigration and experiences in America especially in New York; the New York St. Patrick's Day parade; and Irish American athletics, radio shows, and newspapers. O'Dwyer recounts his experiences as a politician in the U.S., including running for various offices, the development and success of the McBride Principles, his relationship to the Jewish community in New York, his relationship with New York Senator Daniel Moynihan, and his work with the United Nations. He also discusses his experiences as a lawyer, including his involvement with professional organizations, such as the National Lawyers Guild and the Brehon Law Society and specific cases he worked on, such as the Fort Worth Five and Joe Doherty.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eO'Dwyer also discusses Ireland - the history of the discontent between Catholics and Protestants in the North, the civil rights movement, the 1981 hunger strikes, Irish travelers, and the development of the O'Dwyer-Cheshire home and O'Dwyer Forestry Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/scopecontent\u003e\n                \u003cbioghist id=\"ref206\"\u003e\n                    \u003chead\u003eHistorical/Biographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003ePaul O'Dwyer (1907-1998), born in Lismirrane, Parish of Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland, was a politician and lawyer noted for his dedication to civil rights. Arriving in the U.S. in 1925, O'Dwyer enrolled in St. John's Law School the following year and graduated in 1931. In 1932, he joined the law firm O'Dwyer and Bernstein. He began his career defending pickets against labor-organizing injunctions, opposing the deportation of foreign-born agitators, and defending the rights of unionists to organize. He was a member of the National Lawyers Guild and served as president of the New York chapter in 1947.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eO'Dwyer gained success in the courtroom, participating in numerous civil rights struggles in America during the second half of the twentieth century. He worked at registration drives for African Americans in Mississippi during the 1960s, defended Communists and Communist sympathizers during the McCarthy era, vigorously protested the Vietnam War, and battled for the foundation of the state of Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eO'Dwyer participated in politics both by working behind the scenes on other candidates' campaigns and by running his own campaigns. He assisted in John F. Kennedy's 1962 presidential campaign and David Dinkins' 1998 mayoral campaign. O'Dwyer's own campaigns were less successful. Out of a dozen electoral efforts, he lost all but two: the 1963 race for councilman-at-large in Manhattan and the 1973 race for City Council President.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eO'Dwyer managed to maintain his identity as an Irish nationalist and embrace his role as an Irish American. The quest for a united Ireland remained a high priority and during his frequent visits back to Ireland he met with all sides of the conflict, including the Irish Republican Army, the Ulster Defense Association, and the Irish government. He introduced the McBride Principles to the United States government, which prevent U.S. government agencies from investing in Northern Ireland companies that discriminate against their employees. He transformed his childhood home into the O'Dwyer-Cheshire Home for Disabled Children and Adults and established the O'Dwyer Forestry Foundation, both to fund the Cheshire home in the future, and also in an effort to reforest part of Ireland.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eIn addition to his civil rights work in the U.S., O'Dwyer was involved in many Irish American organizations, including the United Irish Counties Association, the Mayo Men's Patriotic and Benevolent Association, the New York St. Patrick's Day Parade Committee, and the Gaelic Athletic Association. His love for New York City and its history led him to assist in the creation of the Department of Records and Information Services (D.O.R.I.S.) to oversee the Municipal Archives and to become the Manhattan Borough Historian in 1986. He was the founder in 1950 of the philanthropic Irish Institute of New York, Inc.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eIn 1990 O'Dwyer was appointed the New York City Commissioner to the United Nations and Consular Corps.

He speaks of how Ireland is still under tyranny and oppression and how he believes the antagonism between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland is not a natural state for either side, but has been developed and fostered as a means of British supremacy.O'Dwyer explains his views on why he did not get reelected as President of the New York City Council. One of the most significant reasons being the development of the women's rights movement.The day after the election, O'Dwyer received a call from David Horowitz, who asked for help because he was being sued by a Hungarian Nazi named Koreh. Horowitz had a small newspaper that supplied news to Jewish communities in the U.S. that were not in the mainstream. Koreh sued Horowitz for libel because the paper reported that Koreh was responsible for killing 100,000 Jews in Transylvania and that he used to ride a white horse and shoot Jews.\u003c/p\u003e\n                        \u003cp\u003e[25:40] Which area was that?\u003c/p\u003e\n                        \u003cp\u003e[29:27] This was at the examination before trial or actually at trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003c/scopecontent\u003e\n                \u003c/c\u003e\n                \u003cc id=\"ref36\" level=\"file\"\u003e\n                    \u003cdid\u003e\n                        \u003cunittitle\u003ePaul O'Dwyer - 24 October 1990\u003c/unittitle\u003e\n                        \u003ccontainer id=\"cid22671023\" type=\"Box\" label=\"Master CD\"\u003e3\u003c/container\u003e\n                        \u003ccontainer parent=\"cid22671023\" type=\"CD\"\u003e4\u003c/container\u003e\n                        \u003ccontainer parent=\"cid22671023\" type=\"Track\"\u003e2\u003c/container\u003e\n                        \u003ccontainer id=\"cid22671022\" type=\"Box\" label=\"Access CD\"\u003e4\u003c/container\u003e\n                        \u003ccontainer parent=\"cid22671022\" type=\"CD\"\u003e4\u003c/container\u003e\n                        \u003ccontainer parent=\"cid22671022\" type=\"Track\"\u003e2\u003c/container\u003e\n                        \u003ccontainer id=\"cid22671024\" type=\"Box\" label=\"Master Cassette\"\u003e1\u003c/container\u003e\n                        \u003ccontainer parent=\"cid22671024\" type=\"Cassette\"\u003e4\u003c/container\u003e\n                        \u003cphysdesc\u003e\n                            \u003cextent\u003e1 master cassette, 1 master compact disc, 1 access compact disc\u003c/extent\u003e\n                        \u003c/physdesc\u003e\n                        \u003cunitdate\u003eOct 24, 1990\u003c/unitdate\u003e\n                        \u003cabstract id=\"ref37\" label=\"Abstract\"\u003e[00:00 - 10:00] Continuing on the Horowitz case, O'Dwyer tells of the Judge's impatience with the case and how during a pre-trial conversation, the Judge ordered Horowitz to apologize for the statement about the white horse because he had no proof and to work the rest out outside of the court.O'Dwyer discusses the importance of the case for him and reveals that Koreh was later convicted for war crimes and served one year in prison in Hungary. He later lied on his application for citizenship about his conviction and became a U.S. citizen. O'Dwyer believes he could not have done this without assistance from some Washington agency.After leaving his post as the President of the City Council, O'Dwyer did not return to work for his old firm O'Dwyer and Bernstien. Instead, he worked for an Italian American organization called CIAO. He introduces another case he was involved with in which a liberal Italian organization was being taken over by another group but gets sidetracked in discussing what has happened with his old law firm.

Flannery focuses mainly on his experiences in Ireland as he recounts his childhood, joining the IRA, serving in the War for Independence and the Civil War, and being imprisoned for two years. Flannery also discusses much of his life in the U.S., including founding and resigning from Noraid, being charged with gunrunning for the IRA, and being Grand Marshal of the St. Patrick's Day Parade.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003c/scopecontent\u003e\n                \u003cbioghist id=\"ref207\"\u003e\n                    \u003chead\u003eHistorical/Biographical Note\u003c/head\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eMichael Flannery (1902-1994), a militant Irish nationalist, was born in Knockshegowna, a small village in the North of County Tipperary, Ireland. He spent his early childhood working on his parents' farm and attending school, but by 1916, the year of the Easter Uprising, Flannery left school to join the Irish Volunteers, a nationalist organization that would later become the Irish Republican Army (IRA). During his active duty with the IRA during both the War for Independence (1919-1921) and the Civil War (1922-1923), Flannery patrolled the Irish countryside, ambushing British soldiers. The British eventually captured him and sent him to prison for two years. In 1927, Flannery emigrated to the United States, married, settled in Jackson Heights, Queens, NY and found a job with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eA devout Catholic, Flannery attended Mass every morning at his local church and neither smoked nor drank. His quiet, undemonstrative character and devotion to the Irish nationalist cause brought him respect and admiration in the Irish American community. Flannery's participation in a multitude of organizations including Clan na Gael, American Congress for Irish Freedom, Gaelic Athletic Association, and Irish Action Committee, earned him the following remark from his lawyer, Frank Durkan: \"If there was going to be a meeting of six people in the north Bronx in the middle of a snowstorm, the only man you knew would be there was Michael Flannery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eAs the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland gained momentum in 1969, tensions increased between Catholics and Protestants and the IRA again rose to the forefront of the struggle. Flannery helped to found the Irish Northern Aid Committee (Noraid) in 1970 to raise funds in the United States to support the families of IRA soldiers who were killed or imprisoned in the North. While the British, Irish, and United States governments believed NORAID to be a front for the IRA, Flannery insisted that, while he supported the IRA's tactics, the money raised did not go to buy arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eIn 1981, Flannery and four other men were charged with gunrunning for the IRA (\n                        \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eU.S. vs. Harrison, Falvey, Mullen, Gormley and Flannery\u003c/emph\u003e). The FBI accused Flannery of handling the money in the transaction. The counsel defending Flannery and the other men took an aggressive strategy during the trial by putting forth the idea that the defendants believed that they were working for the CIA. Since the CIA has a license to export weapons, they did not believe they were breaking any laws. This tactic put the burden on the prosecution to prove that the CIA was not involved and the jury found all five men innocent. Flannery was the only one of the defendants to testify, and he used that opportunity to deliver an impassioned speech about Irish history and British oppression.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eCapitalizing on the publicity from the trial, Irish Republicans campaigned to elect Flannery as the Grand Marshal of the New York St. Patrick's Day Parade in 1983. Given Flannery's open support of the IRA and the recent trial, his nomination did not come without controversy. But despite opposition by prominent politicians, community leaders, the Catholic Church and the Irish government, the parade drew a record crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eIn 1989, Noraid altered its focus to acknowledge the Dublin government and incorporate political measures in resolving the conflict. Flannery and other veterans of his generation believed that a focus on political activities would detract from the fundraising aspects and would ultimately compromise the primary function of the organization. After failing to resolve the differences between his personal beliefs and the new direction the organization was taking, Flannery resigned from Noraid in 1986. He joined the Friends of Irish Freedom in 1989, which had the exclusive purpose of raising money for families of IRA prisoners. He continued his support for FOIF and the militant republican cause until his death in 1994.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003e\n                        \u003cemph render=\"bold\"\u003eSources:\u003c/emph\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eHampson, Rick. \"The Old Man and the Gun.\" \n                        \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eNew York Beacon\u003c/emph\u003e. 31 March 1995, 35.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eHolland, Jack. \n                        \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eThe American Connection: U.S. Guns, Money, and Influence in Northern Ireland\u003c/emph\u003e.

Hynes (1935- ) was born in Brooklyn. As a second-generation Irish American, Hynes first remembers developing his Irish identity from the stories that his grandfather would tell him about emigrating to Boston and the discrimination against the Irish that he witnessed. Although a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians since the early 1970s, Hynes only became publicly active in Irish American activities during the 1981 hunger strikes. His outrage at how the British government treated the hunger strikers led him to join in the protests at the British Embassy and eventually to co-found Irish Solidarity Day.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eHynes graduated from St. John's University Law School in 1961. He began his public service career as an associate attorney with the Brooklyn Legal Aid society. He later became a special state prosecutor in 1985, where he remained until he was elected as the Brooklyn District Attorney in 1989. Hynes has run two unsuccessful primary campaigns for other elected positions: the 1994 race for state attorney general and the 1998 race for governor of New York. He has also taught as an adjunct professor at St. John's Law School, Brooklyn Law School, and Fordham Law School.\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003e\n                        \u003cemph render=\"bold\"\u003eSources:\u003c/emph\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003cp\u003eBarbanel, Josh. \"Hynes to Enter Race for Brooklyn District Attorney.\" \n                        \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/emph\u003e. #1 June 1989.
