He hid the\n        information that he had joined the war effort from his parents. After attending officers'\n        training school, where he studied Spanish and military skills, Costanzo joined the staff of\n        the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, and went with them into heavy action, fighting on at least\n        four fronts. After spending time in a hospital with a sprained ankle, he returned to the\n        front. Constanzo died in Spain in December 1937 or early 1938.
