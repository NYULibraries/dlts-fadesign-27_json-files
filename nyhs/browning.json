Included are Consolidated Edison facilities, but most of the photographs in this series do not bear specific descriptions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWinter Views depict a snow-covered Central Park framed by the towers of Fifth Avenue and Central Park South and West. They are mostly quiet, unpopulated landscapes; the few people in view are a man and child holding hands as they walk down a snowy path, a group of men gazing at the scenery from a horse-drawn carriage, and distant figures walking along a white-on-white horizon. Also included are a few night views that contrast the gleaming snow against a darkened sky.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMiscellaneous and Unidentified Views includes a traffic light, unidentified gravestones, unidentified landscapes and buildings, a man exhaling smoke profiled in a doorway, and some unidentified architectural details.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo boxes at the end of the
