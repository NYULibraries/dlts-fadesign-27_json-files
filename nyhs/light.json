                "value": "When William E. Light donated this collection, he included a note indicating that he received these photographs from his grandmother, Emily Underhill. Emily Underhill was born in 1845 to William Underhill and Martha Maria Barker and married Dewit C. Light in New York in 1869. According to census data, by the 1880s, she was living with her husband and children in South Evanston, IL. Her geographical location during the 1880s strongly suggests that another member of the Underhill family took these photographs. Information about her immediate relatives is difficult to trace, but there were a large number of Underhills living in New York at this time. Of particular interest as possible photographers are two different William Underhills (we know from tracing Emily Underhill's parents and grandparents that William was a recurring family name). A William H. Underhill lived on West 27th Street and worked as a carman or driver in the 1880s; this profession would explain the emphasis on carriages and coaches in this collection. A William K. Underhill worked as a milliner at 5 Union Square West; this location would explain the many photographs of Union Square, and his profession would explain the careful attention the photographer pays to clothing in these photographs. Although we have no way of definitively identifying the photographer, one possibility is that a relative of Emily Underhill (possibly one of the William Underhills mentioned above) took these photographs."

                "value": "\"Snow Scenes; Blizzard of 1888\" contains four approximately 6 x 8 in. photographs and four 4 x 4.5 in. photographs mounted on six boards. A photograph of East 14th Street documents the Blizzard of 1888, which took place on March 13th. People shovel snow from their stoops; some pedestrians walk on the south side of the street that has already been shoveled. Signs are visible for Estey (5 E. 14th Street), Steck Pianos (11 E. 14th Street), and Demorest's Monthly (15-17 E. 14th Street). A night view of snow in Union Square Park bears the ink inscription, \"Midnight, Union Square.\" Another photograph shows rooftops with a dusting of snow. A view of 14th Street taken from a high window shows snow falling; an ink inscription reads, \"Snow squall.\" In addition to Steck Pianos and Demorest's Monthly, this photograph also shows signs for the New York German Conservatory of Music, Billings \u0026amp; Co. Burdett Organs, and Mathushek Pianos. This block of 14th Street (between Fifth Avenue and Union Square) was a popular location for piano stores and music organizations. The small photographs show three men setting up a tripod and camera in the snow in Union Square; men picking their way through snow in Union Square Park (with signs for Rose and Bonnet and Domestic Sewing Machine Co. - at 853 Broadway - in the background); and groups of men shoveling snow on 14th Street. A man stands on top of a large mound of snow while pedestrians walk by on the cleared sidewalk. A group of shovelers takes a break to chat, possibly on Fifth Avenue."
