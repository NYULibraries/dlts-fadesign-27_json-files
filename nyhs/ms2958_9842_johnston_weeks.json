Johnston asked Weeks if he would like to conclude the sale for a $50 commission. Johnston also wrote that he offered to sell to his brother in Chicago other parts of his land, and that Weeks might get inquiries from the brother. Finally, Johnston asked Weeks to determine the taxes on various of his other properties.
