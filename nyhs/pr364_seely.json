Most cards are personalized with their names printed inside; from 1978—the year Leonard died—through 1993, only Alice’s name appears. The cards show typical secular Christmas imagery like wreaths, candles, lanterns, bells, snow scenes, holly, reindeer, Christmas trees, and Santa Claus. The sole religious/biblical image—of the Three Wise Men, or Magi—appears on the card for 1955. The card for 1953 doubles as a change-of-address notice for the Seelys, who moved from one Bay Ridge, Brooklyn apartment (185 Marine Avenue) to another (9902 Third Avenue). In the nearly sixty-year span of the scrapbook, only one card is duplicated: the one inscribed “The Very Best from Florida” was sent in 1970 \n                \u003cemph render=\"italic\"\u003eand\u003c/emph\u003e 1971."
