The 38-story steel-frame building rose straight up from the street lot-line without any setbacks. It was the largest office building in the world at the time, and the last skyscraper to be constructed before building regulations were instituted in the city. The construction of the Equitable Building was an important catalyst for New York City’s 1916 Zoning Resolution, the first in the country, which aimed to restrict the height and bulk of buildings and assure the penetration of light and air to the streets below. The Equitable Building was designated a New York City landmark in 1996."
