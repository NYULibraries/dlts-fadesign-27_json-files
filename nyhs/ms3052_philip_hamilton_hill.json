The volume includes tipped-in clippings concerning Luther Hill’s death and Philip’s transcription of the last letter Luther sent to his wife Anna, as well as other related items. In the volume is a bookmark with the words “Remember Me”; possibly this is one of the bookmarks given to Hill by Miss Bear (29 April 1862).
