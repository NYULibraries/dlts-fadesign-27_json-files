In the Cold War era, Fort Totten served as the Headquarters for 1st Region NIKE missile defense system for New York and New England from 1954 to 1974. Under a military downsizing plan, Congress approved the closing of Fort Totten in 1995, though the U.S. Army Reserve continues to maintain a presence there. Fort Totten was designated a New York City Historic District in 1999, preserving over 100 historic structures related to New York's role in U.S. military history and harbor defense. In 2004, 49.5 acres of the area was turned over to the NYC Parks Department, and in 2005 Fort Totten Park opened to the public."
